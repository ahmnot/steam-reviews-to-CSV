A extractor of data from pages like these: https://steamcommunity.com/app/439550/reviews/?browsefilter=mostrecent&snr=1_5_100010_&p=1&filterLanguage=all which outputs the reviews to a nice CSV file. 
You have to go to the inspector and copy the content of this div: <div id="AppHubCards" class="apphub_Cards">, inside the "steam_reviews.html" file.
