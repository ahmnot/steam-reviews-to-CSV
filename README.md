A extractor of data from pages like these: https://steamcommunity.com/app/439550/reviews/?browsefilter=mostrecent&snr=1_5_100010_&p=1&filterLanguage=all which outputs the reviews to a nice CSV file. 
You have to go to the inspector and copy the content of the div with the id="AppHubCards", inside html files that you put in a folder, then change the folder directory in steamReviewsToCSV.js in order for the html files to be converted to CSV.
