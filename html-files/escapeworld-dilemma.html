								Escapeworld Dilemma is a solid puzzle, open-world exploration game. It is basically an 'escape the world' by visiting all locations and solving problems related to colors, numbers, music, light refraction, and pattern extensions. There is also a limited amount of collection and crafting required (gathering ingredients for a series of manufacturing processes) and then running those processes. All in all, it is a beautifully crafted and diverse environment with a medium level of challenge.  It was developed by just a couple of guys which is pretty amazing.<br><br>The gist of the story is that you have been teleported to Escapeworld (without your permission) and your job is to get back home. The journey is a bit complicated and took me 20+ hours of game time to complete. More of my time was spent finding new areas and working through the manufacturing processes than getting stuck on puzzles. The sound track is primarily environmental effects but I got myself into trouble playing with the sound off when I hit a musical clue!<br><br>I would recommend it to those who like to explore and solve puzzles with one caveat. This is an early access game. It feels complete but there are still quite a few kinks that the development team is working out. I only encountered one bug in a puzzle solution (which I was able to brute force) and there is one puzzle (quarry) that I am not convinced can be solved with the information in the game. I solved this by contacting another player who had gotten the solution from the developer. Other than that, you will be wise to save in multiple slots and save often. I encountered some glitches related to buttons not working, doors closing, engine freezes, etc. Most all could be resolved by exiting and reloading my last save file. Since I tend to take a lot of notes in this type of game, this was slightly irritating but not overwhelming to me. I might be inclined to wait for the game to go on sale, if I had it all to do over.<br><br>I will note that the developer is exceptionally responsive and is actively working with players to resolve issues that are encountered. He responds to forum questions or email and has been very pleasant to work with.<br><br>I especially enjoyed the exploration - there are different islands that you teleport or ride a tram to go between. There are unique areas with some fun details if you are paying attention. There is a drone that you can fly and use to move objects between islands. Cruising at a high elevation gives you a great way to get the lay of the land before setting off on foot. Controls are easy (standard WASD and mouse) and all in all, it was a very pleasant game experience.			</div>

																Escapeworld Dilemma is a Myst type puzzle game where you are an unwilling participant who has been transported to an “amusement park” by someone who obviously doesn't like you for some unknown reason. There, you must solve numerous puzzles in order to escape, however, you soon learn that in order to escape, you have to select someone to replace you (preferably someone you don't like for some unknown reason). When you reach your goal, assuming that you do, you can take the easy way out, or you can try to break the cycle thus saving everyone on the list a major headache.<br><br>Pros:<br>Many puzzles to solve<br>Good animations<br>Two endings<br>Longer than I thought<br>Graphics are well done<br>Non-linear<br>Simple controls<br><br>♥♥♥♥:<br>Some pixel hunting<br>A few of the puzzles are nonsensical (at least I didn't find any rhyme or reason to it)<br>Puzzles range from medium to “Are you kidding me?”<br>A few overlapping textures<br><br>This is the second game in which I had a 'love/hate relationship' with, the first being Phoning Home. You really need to keep your eyes open and obverse everything. This makes the game very tedious and slow going, then you find out that most of the things that you noted are nothing but red herrings. But if you become complacent and go at a quicker pace, then you'll most likely miss a clue that will have you stranded for hours, unless you look up the answer.<br><br>Most of the puzzles are well thought out and logical, but there are a couple that I had no idea how to solve. Eventually, I gave up and went to the internet for the answer only to find out that the solution is just as baffling as the puzzle. Not enough clues or clues that are so convoluted that nearly no one will solve them is a major complaint of mine.<br><br>At the time of the review, Escapeworld Dilemma was selling for $14.99. Take out the puzzles that make little to no sense or add some clues for them, then this game can be great. As it stands now, it's okay but I would wait for a sale if you don't want to pay full price to be aggravated.			</div>

																As a adventure-puzzle fan and a Myst fan I really enjoyed this. There were some puzzles that initially made me scratch my head, but I felt once you figured out the mechanic you were good for the rest of that series. I loved being able to teleport around and being able to make multiple saves. The addition of piloting a drone around to see things you otherwise wouldn't, was pretty cool as well. <br><br>Other reviews mention glitches and one mentions the dev being good about fixing them once posted, so for me I only experienced 2 possible glitches. But on the intro screen as the developer suggested, I saved often so both were resolved easily. <br>⠀•⠀One was loading a save at the refinery and some objects didn't load in, so there was no walkway to leave. <br>⠀•⠀The other was at the end exit puzzle. Once placing the cubes down and opening the gate. I walked in and was some how holding the last cube I placed. So i was trapped inside. <br><br>For older gamers, there is a certain code in one of the endings that will no doubt leave you singing a certain old song :D: <br>Loved it.			</div>

																It's a great puzzle game, reminded me a bit of The Witness. There was a lot of variation and the differently themed areas also add to the fun. I didn't encounter a lot of bugs, only two really. The developer is very responsive and quick to fix problems.<br>It helps to save regularly and use all the save slots so in case you're unable to continue because of a bug you don't lose too much progress.<br>There is currently no options menu which seemed a bit odd but I think the developer is still working on implementing one.<br>My only complaint are the drone controls. I wish there were separate buttons for gaining/losing altitude.			</div>

																Nicely done! In my continuous quest to find games like Quern, Obduction, and of course the Myst series, I stumbled upon this gem the day it was released.<br><br>Pros:<br>The puzzles are well done. I like that you are rewarded when they are solved and they advance the game play and story. They are not puzzles for the sake of solving puzzles, like The Witness, where you get puzzle fatigue. There were only a couple of times where I got stuck to the point of wanting a walk through guide, but the game is too new for one. As such, like in the Witness, sometimes you have to step back and look at the big picture. Then the solution suddenly presents itself. For you Jesse Stone fans, “if you don’t like the answers you’re getting, check your premises”.<br><br>The crafting was fun. It adds another “adventure element” to the game.<br><br>The atmosphere was beautiful and inviting. I love these types of games, but I have to want to be in it and comfortable. It makes you want to come back. There are some of these games that I am done after 10 minutes because I don’t want to be there (if that makes any sense). There is a nice variety of “scenes” with the different islands, which adds to the enjoyment of the exploration.<br><br><br>♥♥♥♥ (minor):<br>There are still some graphics issues in places, but only one that may have ruined the game play and would have made me go back to the last save, which luckily, I didn’t have to do. I accidentally discovered that I was able to push the laser splitter through a wall before the door was opened. Had I released it, I may have been stuck. There was also a moment mid game where I was up in the drone and many of the building had disappeared below. They were back after I landed, so no harm.<br><br>The walking on carpet sound is ….interesting. 😊<br><br>No biggy, but IMO there are 3 missing Steam achievements:<br>	Finding the easter egg(s)<br>	Eating all of the food/donuts (although they re-appear after returning to a saved game)<br>	Harvesting all of the flowers (maybe all of the coal, but would require a return trip to one of the mines after crafting)<br><br>Highly recommended!<br><br>-Snoop<br>			</div>

																Some of the puzzles are very intuitive. The rest are a complete nightmare. Just completely random on how/where to solve some things. Easy mode is supposed to provide hints, but doesn't do that at all. <br><br>The game is poorly optimized and frame drops a lot even on high end hardware. <br><br>No options menu. No auto save. Lots of opportunities to irrevocably break your game.			</div>

																The awesomeness of this game completely shocked me. Based on the bland title and screenshots, it looked like just another bad indie puzzle game that I would either quit out of boredom or frustration. I was NOT expecting the best puzzle game I played since the Talos Principle and one of the best Myst-like games ever made. Truly a hidden gem.			</div>

																I really like these types of games, but this one still contains too many bugs. The puzzles in the first area are pretty simple, but getting stuck because of bugs is not my idea af fun. Additionally there is no way to change the mouse (in my case trackball) movement sensitivity, and it is painful to look around and change direction because of this.			</div>

																This game is a very tricky Mystlike game that is exceptionally rough around the edges. Some of the logic is not easily conveyed. I got stuck on the first few levels until I understood it was a game of colour-mixing, and it fell into place a bit.<br><br>At random times, the game decides to hyperfocus on a single aspect - be it a word, a musical tune or otherwise. These focuses can cross entire islands in this game. You likely will need a walkthrough the first time. Some aspects - like a later Quarry level - are not very intuitive and many things require you specifically click in specific elements, like handles or keyholes on doors.<br><br>However, despite these flaws and difficulties, I would recommend this game. I'd suggest getting it on sale, £13 is a bit steep for a game this rough around the edges. But it is certainly not a regrettable experience. It is clear this is a first attempt, and for that, it is a very good game. I look forward to the next game where I am certain the experience and feedback from this game will help the quality of the next.			</div>

																TL:DR Overall, I would give this game a 6.5/10 due to unfinished and difficult mechanics.<br><br>If I were to describe this game in one word, it would be "janky". I am a huge fan of puzzle games, and I love the thought behind some of the puzzles, For example, <span class="bb_spoiler"><span> I enjoyed how I could use my sense of observation and use my environment to give hints about each puzzle, </span></span> but this game was often very rough around the edges. It was moderately enjoyable, but the experience felt bland. There was very little music to create an atmosphere either. Now, I know that is often a preference thing, so this can be easily excused, but I had other issues too. <br><br>The most relevant of which is when I saved my game in a specific location <span class="bb_spoiler"><span> (one of the front patios in the wild west area), </span></span> and then returning to the game resulted in my being frozen in place. Therefore, I lost a lot of progress and had to go back to a much earlier previous save. Another issue I had was when I was supposed to use a clue to open a door; I tried to type in one idea, and it didn't work. So I tried to get creative about it and try other ideas. Ultimately, my first idea was right, but somehow it didn't work the first time and I had ruled it out as a possibility until I was forced to look up the answer. Of course, once I looked up the answer, it showed me that my original guess was correct, and the second time, it worked. More specifically, <span class="bb_spoiler"><span> I was trying to open the safe in the house under the big wind turbine, and I tried the 4 digit code that was displayed on the clock and it did not work. I suspect that the issue is one of two things: either the clock changed its value as I typed the code in, so my code was one digit off, and I didn't realize the issue, OR I had input a number prior to attempting the code. Let's say I was fiddling with the numbers and typed a 5 before coming to the conclusion that typing 1230 was the answer, so the input to the safe read 51230, even though I thought it read 1230. I think this issue could be avoided if the input pad displayed the numbers OR if it only accepted a 4 digit code at the maximum. Or both! But I was not shown what I input, and it was possible to input a code up to 8 digits, even though the answer was only 4 digits.  </span></span> This was really frustrating.<br><br>Another issue was that <span class="bb_spoiler"><span> all of a sudden, the videos showing the creator of "Escapeworld" would just stop outputting any audio. I have no idea why, but I couldn't find any setting that could fix this issue. After the first video or two, the audio just stopped coming out, so I had to look up walkthroughs just to find out what he was saying. </span></span> <br><br>Another really bothersome issue was that the settings did not give any method of showing the player how to use items obtained. When I went to obtain some items, <span class="bb_spoiler"><span> such as the xray wand or teleportation gun, </span></span> they could just disappear into my inventory, and I would have no clue how to call it to use it, leaving me confused as to whether I'm doing something wrong. <br><br>I also had issues with picking up items and getting them stuck in strange locations. For example, <span class="bb_spoiler"><span> when I needed to use a book to put on a pressure plate in the area near the safe (as mentioned above), there were instances I would lose the books and get them stuck behind the bookshelf or in a strangely inaccessible location behind the sofa. </span></span><br><br>Lastly, there is a drastic game exploit I discovered where I could skip some "necessary" areas to progress in others. More specifically, <span class="bb_spoiler"><span> if the drone is carrying a colored block, and I click "2" to bring the drone back to the Inport pad, I can make the block come with it and the block is now at Inport where I wanted it, even though I did NOT use a designated cargo pad where you are supposed to drop the blocks. </span></span><br><br>Not everything about this game was negative. I liked some of the creative ways solutions were presented to us players. But overall, there were a lot of problems, and I'm honestly amazed that this game was released to the public with how many glitches and exploits I found.			</div>

																alright, warning: game is janky and a little buggy, and it's low budget, but if you're into like B films or whatever, it's super fun. the visuals are decent and most of the puzzles are solid. playing with hints on is helpful and doesn't "ruin" things really. and the dev has been responsive to my questions as well.			</div>

																This was a delightful romp.  Similar to The Witness in that you are mostly taking a simple puzzle concept and reiterating on it with the odd deviation here and there.  It doesn't have quite the legs of that game, but manage to be it's own brand of fun, with just enough story to contextualize what you are doing.<br><br>However, the game is all manner of buggy.  In a couple of locations this led to me thinking I was missing something on a puzzle, when in reality the interactions had to be done from a very specific angle (or had broken and needed a save reload).  There are also a miriad of different ways that you can get yourself trapped or lock yourself out of progress if you aren't careful, so using the save feature and keeping multiple saves as you go is highly recommended.  On that note, make sure you use the "load save" option rather than "return to game" option after saving, as there is a glitch which will keep your cursor interacting with the menu, rather than your game, effectively forcing a quit and save load anyways.			</div>

																This would be an alright game to enjoy but there are too many bugs at the moment that make certain locations of the world almost unplayable. The first location(what they call Inport) once inside the building is the worst to be in because the game freezes so often and it takes some waiting before it finally gives you back control to move along to where you need to go. I've had to reload the game in some instances through previous saves, often had to force shut-down as well to get out of these buggy glitches. Outside and at most all other places works fine if you can tolerate the constant motion blur of every turn of the camera.  --then I get into Outport's building and the freezing screens all happen again. But this time it just stays frozen to the point I cannot access either one of the 2 doors which could possibly end the game. I've attempted multiple times after restarting and reloading the game again and again or just trying to wait it out(to no avail) and decided to just give up and wait for possibly an update that will work all of the kinks out so I can maybe later come back to this and finish it. Until then, it's not happening and I lack the patience any further to tolerate this game. Thumbs down on this in it's current state...			</div>

																Escapeworld Dilemma is an adventurous, open-world game, intended for players who like a lot of logic puzzles.<br>At first glance, the game seems small and short, but as soon as the puzzles start, it changes the impression of the game itself.<br>We played the game until it was complete. There are both easy and difficult puzzles.<br>During the game, we encountered a lot of irregularities (stuck in the texture, deterioration through the interface, cracking graphics, etc ...)<br>In collaboration with Joe, all this has been resolved and the game in the set gives the players an unforgettable adventure.<br>Our personal opinion about the game: There could have been a few more puzzles because if we look at the map we will see that there is still a lot of unused space.<br>The game can match other games, such as: The Talos Principe, The Witness, etc.<br><br>We would like to take this opportunity to thank Sonoma Games for their cooperation, and we can't wait for another project of theirs ...			</div>

																Très bon myst like . Beaux graphismes et nombreux endroits à visiter, énigmes originales et logiques mais certaines parfois difficiles à résoudre. Uniquement en anglais mais un anglais basique est suffisant. Bonne durée de jeu si l'on explore tous les endroits ( indispensable si l'on veut arriver au bout car il faut ramasser des fleurs ). Je n'ai rencontré aucun bug et je recommande vivement si l'on aime ce genre de jeu.			</div>

								Escapeworld Dilemma is a very good puzzle and exploration game.  It takes place on a good-sized map spanning several islands which you will be exploring by walking around, flying a drone, riding a tram from island to island, or teleporting yourself around the islands. It had a mix of simple, medium and hard puzzles, emphasis more on medium. Some good mechanics used in several of the puzzles. Some good environments to explore. The story had an interesting twist for you to decide how to make your escape. I’ve played Portal, Talos Principle and Obduction and enjoyed playing Escapeworld Dilemma.<br>			</div>

																I've played a lot of escape/puzzle games, and this is the worst I've tried in a while. Truly terrible- for some reason the clue to a very early puzzle just does not show up on my game, forcing me to watch a video walkthrough to figure out what I'm missing (not missing in game, literally missing from the game entirely) so I can continue. I've also accidentally dropped cubes, creating an unwinnable game, twice and needed to restart. I gave this game an hour and I'd like my hour back. Buggy, crappy puzzles, with endless unwinnable situations. <br>An example, after looking up the answer to the gate code for the FIRST room, which is completely missing in my game, you encounter a simple color puzzle. There's an obvious answer to the puzzle in the same eyeline, in the same room. But that's not the answer, no, because this game hates you and wants to frustrate you at every turn. The answer is for NO DISCERNIBLE REASON the colors of something inside the fridge, entirely outside the eyeline of this puzzle. <br>Puzzle games should reward thought and logic.<br><br>EDIT- just wanted to say The Witness does this a thousand times better, and The Room games are more engaging if you're looking for some good puzzles.			</div>

																Promising at first, quickly deteriorated. Disclaimer: I didn't make it very far into the game at all before deciding it wasn't worth my time continuing.<br><br> Let's get things out of the way: The assets are most likely all bought from stores without any further modification. I'm not against this per se, the island looks good and clean and things mostly fit (except the text overlays), but it doesn't feel unique or interesting, or that much visually appealing unless you like extreme realism. <br>Also, the game runs like ♥♥♥♥. Huge fps drops every time you move the camera,  <i>even in the devs' own walkthrough that he posted on youtube</i>. Anything above low for most 'old' machines, and the game is going to be a pain to play. I have a 1070 and have ran games more graphically demanding than this. <br> Having said that, I don't personally think low graphics make a game bad, but in this case setting the graphics to low makes important clues blurry, which is just baffling. And while we're on the topic, I  <i> really </i> don't think the realistic graphics justify the whopping 19 GYGABYTES that the game takes. This type of experience can work on any graphics because it's not about graphics, it's about the puzzles and the ambience. If you don't know how to work with demanding things, choose something on the lower end, it's not a crime and would probably make the game more appealing to fanatics if it had stylised low poly assets.<br><br> A lot of people report game breaking bugs, but the only bug I've encountered were objects clipping through each other. I'd probably be more mad if I was further along the game and couldn't easily restart, but I can't honestly say the bugs I encountered impeded my progress.<br><br>Now, the puzzles, the reason you're here, oh boy: The first few puzzles, while extremely easy, were enjoyable and set the mood well for an escape island game. It was mostly pattern recognition of number and color sequences, finding a key behind a rug and turning on a power generator to activate other regions of the place. Then the game haves you quickly grab a cube through a door that closes when the cube is not in place to use it for something else. This is not clever, has no connection to the other puzzles, or even is a puzzle in itself. If we go by the logic that if we were in a remote island we could physically do these things, then I could've easily have jumped over all the fences without activating anything, or broken the window to the house I couldn't get in. Just lazy, feels more like a speedrun strat than a puzzle. Also, the cube we get is used to open a door that was artificially closed after crossing it. That door is first opened by a puzzle, and it was the only door I encountered that closed after solving it.<br><br> The immediate next puzzle is a number code, which you find placed in a blurry, poorly lit and completely inconspicuous energy meter. I hope I don't have to say why this is lazy too.<br><br> The immediate immediate next puzzle has you get yet another code, this time with colors. There are 4 coloured vases in plain view of the area next to the puzzle, they are mostly the first thing you see when you enter, and they were obviously put there for the player to notice. This pattern doesn't work. Instead, you need to open a prop which I thought was just for decoration, survey yet another blurry, poorly lit and inconspicuous set of item and put that code instead.<br><br> After that I quit. While technically competent, this is a case of a first time dev that took too much on their shoulders and ended up delivering a sub-par product. Dev, if you're still reading reviews, I really hope you learn from the things you did badly and keep the things that worked, of which I'm sure there are many I didn't notice. There's really a lot of potential here, and I would love to see what you could do with all the knowledge you got while working on this game.			</div>

																This is not a good game. The puzzles are unintuitive at times, feels bland compared to some puzzle games, and the way it was formatted with settings is a pain in the ass. plus it requires a REALLY good computer to run smoothly, though they have improved it. Also, weird bug where it opens steam VR when it launches. If you see me with a lot of time in this game, Its only for the achievements.			</div>

																No auto-save and the game is extremely buggy. I replayed more than an hours worth of gameplay because of multiple crashes. You can also become trapped due to map disappearing around you and the videos don't always work.  It has some awesome puzzles in it though. Reminds me a lot of The Witness.			</div>

																For an indy project, this game is really impressive and expansive. It isn't a demo, it's a full-fledged puzzle adventure which builds upon earlier puzzles in interesting ways. Some of the graphics have minor flaws, but nothing that necessarily detracts from the quality of the gameplay.<br><br>Highly recommend, and would further like to thank the creator for sharing this project with the world. It's really inspiring.<br><br>We did have a UI glitch very early in the game, but that was the only disruptive problem.			</div>

																This is a really challenging and fun game. It's kept me entertained for hours and has totally kept me thinking. Ever since Myst came out so long ago, I have loved these immersive, 1st person, puzzle explore games and this is up there with Cyan's work. It reminds me a lot of Witness, but a lot less surreal and for more straight forward. Plus it has a lot of fun variety in the tasks and I'm enjoying the humor. I'm only about 80% of the way through, but I look forward to finally "escaping" :)			</div>

																There's a couple small glitchy things, but I thought it was fun. The puzzles are interesting and take a little thought, but follow logical reasoning for the most part. It actually took me about 9 hours to play (both endings) which is nice compared to some of the 1-2 hour escape games. It's sort of scenic, and there's little spots that add a little charm to an escape room game. Overall nice game for basically being created by one guy.			</div>

																Well it was a fun game but it has a lot of bugs, freezes all the time , so annoying. I tried removing it and installing it again, now the scenery of the game is half missing, So glad I didn't pay for it and it was free.<br>Too bad.			</div>

I overlooked something and I checked to see if I was right on the google box ---- <br>The puzzles weren't super hard but they  still took critical thinking skills and didn't make me feel like I am too stupid to exist ( stares in MYST) - I have about 6 pages of notes I scribbled out along the way to help me solve everything.<br>Fun environment.<br><br><br>			</div>

																Experience:  Overall very enjoyable. I love colorful games.  Colors, numbers and shapes are integral to many solutions throughout the game. Love the free movement, there were lots of interesting areas to explore with atmospheres ranging from natural to industrial.<br><br>Difficulty: Mostly not too difficult, but at times a little un-intuitive. I know this is a difficult balance to achieve in this type of game's design.  Pressing "H" during play reveals hints as written notes or voice responses.  I had to use the hints at several points, but felt they revealed the right amount of info, not too much.  <br>There were a couple of mazes, something I seem to struggle with, but these were not overly complicated at all.<br><br>Sound: no music at all and the sounds were basic.  In fact I think they were mostly public domain sound files. <br> Some more variety would be nice, and an attempt at more immersiveness.  (There's a point where you ride through a tunnel and the mechanical sounds don't change at all. Takes me out of the moment a little but YMMV.)<br><br>Conclusion:  had fun playing, will definitely check out anything else the developers are working on.  I recommend giving it a try if you like solving puzzles instead of running and shooting at everything.<br>			</div>

																This game was clearly a labor of love. It brought me right back to classic 90's adventure puzzle games (Rhem, Myst, etc.).  Graphics are pretty basic, but if you are looking for puzzles, this is a fun one. I'm just glad the developers put a walkthrough on YouTube, because there were a couple of times when I was well and truly stuck (due to not noticing some small detail, usually).  <span class="bb_spoiler"><span> I'm talking to you, colored gateways with direction arrows. Like, I did not notice that the force fields had a direction, at all. D'oh. </span></span> I do wish the story was a little more interesting (um, it's called Escapeworld Dilemma because your dilemma is how to escape. Yeah.). Despite this weakness, I definitely had a few delightful "ohhhhh, I get it," moments. The puzzles had a fun twist (colors and numbers and shapes, oh, my!). An enjoyable time for fans of logic puzzles.			</div>

																I enjoyed this game.  From the credits, it looks like mostly the work of a single person, which makes the game quite an impressive achievement.   It seems well imagined and beautifully designed to me.<br><br>The game had some glitches here and there.  Mostly these were minor rendering anomalies, but In two places I became trapped because of what seemed like a glitch, and had to back up to the most recent save.  (So be sure to save often.)<br><br>As far as the puzzles go, I got stuck and consulted the walkthrough three times.  After seeing two of the answers, I felt like I should have been able to solve the puzzle on my own, but one of the puzzles did seemed unfair to me after seeing the solution.  All of the rest of the puzzles were fair and satisfying, and some of them took me a while to figure out.<br><br>In some places I wished for less travelling around, and occasionally a little less busywork.<br><br>This game is not quite in the same class as The Witness, Quern, Talos Principle, or The Room Series, but it is extremely respectable as the work of approximately one person, and worth trying if you like the puzzle genre.<br><br>I hope that the principal developer will come out with more games.  I would perhaps suggest bringing in some helpers who are really good at quality assurance and testing, so that the next game can have fewer glitches and really live up to its potential.			</div>

																Escape World offers a number of admittedly fun puzzles.<br>I did enjoy a number of them.<br>Ultimately though, there is just a bit too much that is annoying in the game to recommend it.<br><br>Awkward controls I can forgive, given that this is a such a personal effort. It still can be galling, especially when the game does include platforming, to a very low degree, but still, bad choice.<br>One of the very early puzzle solutions felt like a glitch to me and I was puzzling over whether I cheated or not.<br>Some other puzzles just felt very annoying and tedious for the interface.<br>Turning objects little step by little step, transporting stuff around one by one...<br>In one case, an important clue was hard to access without reloading an older save file for checking.<br>Some puzzles also repeated in what essentially amounted to busy work.<br><br>I would prefer to give this game a rating of mixed, but all in all, the negatives slightly outdid the positives.<br><br>I would recommend it if you really, really want more puzzles and went through Games like Quern, The Witness, The Room series and such and are okay with one that is maybe not the best, but I do recommend to check out other titles of this kind first.<br><br>Still, looking at the credits, it is still a commendable effort in many aspects, so I would try another game by the same developer.<br>			</div>

																I recommend this game with some reservations (6 out of 10). The puzzles are mostly intuitive, although I had to use a walkthrough to solve four of them, and I still do not understand the solutions to these. There is plenty of territory to explore, but unfortunately some of it is just scenery to look at, without giving you much to do as far as game play (for example, the Western town was disappointing). My biggest problem is that the program is glitchy. Several times the scenery would vanish and leave you stranded. I lost a significant saved game and had to replay a good portion of the game to return to where I had been. And one time I fell through a "hole" and ended up trapped outside the game world. But if you can get it on sale, it was mostly enjoyable.			</div>

																I very much enjoyed the puzzles in this game.  If you like games like The Witness or Quern, you will likely enjoy this game as well.  I do think there are a few places that could use a little polish (I had a case where a pressure sensor didn't seem to activate as it should have until I fiddled with it) but these were relatively minor.  Definitely worth the price.<br><br>I must admit I did look up hints in a few places, only due to limited time I wanted to spend, and I didn't see anything that seemed too unintuitive, but obviously this affected my experience.			</div>

																I liked this game until the crafting part.  I don't like harvesting and cutting stone but I knew about it beforehand so I won't let it drag down this review.  The puzzles were top notch.  I liked the open world and composition of the color puzzles.  Solving them was fun.  This game doesn't autosave so don't forget to save often.  Be careful going past blocks you've placed that open locations.  I must've brushed too close to the red block in the beginning of the game and it fell off the pressure plate locking me in the area with the propane tank. Save after you access new areas and/or make a wide path around blocks on pressure plates.  Overall great game!			</div>

																As a fan of escape room games, I really enjoyed Escapeworld Dilemma. The puzzle design was fantastic and most of it was unlike anything I had seen in other games.<br><br>However, it needs a warning: there's no tutorial, no learning curve, etc. it just throws you immediately into hard puzzles. I needed quite a few hints (the dev actively helps on the forums) before I got into the right mindset to find the solutions myself. That said, I appreciate it - it didn't hold my hand and now I'm a better puzzle solver as a result.			</div>

																Very buggy program.  Don't waste your money.  Bugs include: dropped boxes may roll through solid walls and become irretrievable.  When that happened to me, since I was barely into the game, I tried to start a new game, but each attempt crashed consistently after the intro video with "rendering thread has timed out".  Yes, I rebooted, etc.  Bugs, no support, no refund.			</div>

																A great variety of puzzles keep this game interesting and challenging. The Island map seemed small initially but I found myself exploring for hours trying to find my way through the game. The game strikes a very good balance of giving some direction but also leaving you to your wits and not babying the player through the puzzles with hints and cues like other puzzle games. Highly recommend.			</div>

																Considering this was pretty put together by one person, it's really impressive, but more so that most other games in the genre, it really feels like you are trying to out-think that person and if you aren't on the same wavelength then it can be very frustrating. Even the hints are in places where the developer thought you might need help and so if you don't think the same way, you could easily be left without hints either.<br><br>Having said that, if you enjoy games like The Witness or Myst then there are some fun puzzles to work through here and the story behind it is quite fun to work through.<br><br>If you do come to this after playing something like The Witness then there are some things it's good to know about (although this is probably an unfair comparison considering this is essentially a one person project).<br><br>- The puzzle types tend to skip around quite a lot so unlike a game like The Witness where each area is a puzzle type with incremental difficulty, here you just find different puzzles and the signposting is sometimes lacking.<br>- In The Witness everything feels very purposefully placed whereas here the world feels very noisy which means you can easily read things as red herrings.<br>- Other games tend to do a good job of opening up the world in such a way that as you progress you keep opening up shortcuts back which mean you avoid a lot of backtracking. Towards the end of this one it does feel like there is a lot of running around.<br>- The graphics are a curious mix. I put off getting this for a some time because the island view of this game makes it look really ugly, but when you get into individual locations, it's actually quite pretty.<br>- The use of the different map areas isn't very balanced. Some areas you'll be around a lot, other areas you'll speed through and never look at again, which feels like a shame.<br><br>Overall, if you are OK with a bit of jankiness and frustration, (or are OK with looking up some hints to keep things moving) then there is a lot to enjoy in this game. It is giving it's own take on the first person puzzle genre and it does at times feel like it's doing something a little different. It's not as polished as other games in the genre but I think it's still worth your time.			</div>

																Игра  атмосферная, стильные локации - не без небольших огрехов, конечно. Головоломки с далеко не всегда очевидными решениями, над которыми нужно хорошенько подумать. Большая площадь воспроизведенного острова со многими вкусными деталями и неожиданными закоулками. Коптер )) В общем, хорошее впечатление и несколько интересно проведенных вечеров. Рекомендую			</div>

																<div class="bb_h1">Decent entertainment</div>If You - as I do - like games in the Myst/Uru/Rhem style (so mainly exploring alone one or several worlds/islands, no killing or otherwise hectic activity involved, no zombies/ghouls/vampires, Freddie Krueger or comparable nonsense), then this is for You. It does not really differ from games in this vein, but it contributes an interesting variant of tasks often involved (<span class="bb_spoiler"><span>in this case the manufacturing of colored cubes,</span></span> no more spoilers). You need to get acquainted to the basic scheme of this game, You then have to explore everything with the drone (nice idea), all of this is done quite carefully. The puzzles are solvable, the different tasks kept the game interesting throughout, and the graphics are good. My only complaint would be: wasd-keys, I hate these, this normally is the death sentence for a game (that I continued and finished nevertheless shows how much I liked Escapeworld Dilemma from the beginning).<br><b>Bottomline: My 3 favorite recent games are Quern, Obduction and Talos; if You can't stand these, go away, You will probably hate Escapeworld Dilemma; if You like these, give Escapeworld Dilemma a try, You will probably like this one also.</b>			</div>

																Really enjoyed the concept of this game and how it uses similar puzzle ideas in different ways to constantly keep you guessing. For the price and game play, if you like a frustrating puzzles and problem solving then it's a definite buy. The only reason I didn't initially recommend is due to two game errors which has froze the game in a state between the pause lobby and my save file (almost a ghost version of the pause lobby,) which has now left me having to re start again twice and I'm not sure if I'll carry on. Buy but keep saving on different slots and be prepared for the odd loading bug.<br><br>Edit: A quick reply from the dev from the above issues gave me the confidence to restart. Full play through and completion with no further bugs. Try not to cheat or get hints if possible as the solutions are rewarding when you spend the time to work them out, more often than the not the answer is right in front of you. Great game and we'll worth the price.			</div>

								This is a really good adventure puzzle game.  The environment is very large spanning multiple islands with different geographies and themes, from high desert to the depths of a coal mine.  The graphics are gorgeous, I spent hours just flying the drone to look at the fantastic detail.  The puzzles and puzzle mechanics I found medium to hard, there was nothing I would class as simple, although all the puzzles can be solved by spotting particular sequences or<br>combinations and with the clues and hints that are left for you to find. I only got frustrated once when I couldn't find a particular location, which turned out to be a case of not looking everywhere (and there's a lot of everywhere to look at).  For an early access game it is very robust.  I found one bug that could crash the game and a couple of puzzles where the puzzle mechanics would allow you to wreck a working solution if you were heavy handed.  Joe at Sonoma was very responsive and was going to fix these.  All in all, more than worth the price paid.			</div>

																Graphics are fine for the purpose, realistic enough without beng over-detailed.   P.uzzles are intriguing but solvable.   We had a lot of fun playing this game, excellent, and we didn't need to refer to a walk-through.   Enjoyed flying the drone, exploring by air.<br><br>I think that it is possible to get stuck; putting a cube on the paint machine before it is loaded with paint can cause the cube to be stcuk in the machine.   If this cube is one from the grid puzzle before iti is solved, you have to go back to an earlier save.			</div>

																Underholdende, god grafik. Mange små gåder og nogle er mere komplicerede end andre. Alle gåder har hints i nærheden et eller andet sted, og man skal ikke gå fra den ene ende af parken til den anden, fordi man mangler et item. Kan anbefales, tager ca 30 timer at gennemføre (for mig).			</div>
