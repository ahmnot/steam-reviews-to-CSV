																Ctrl Alt Ego is an Immersive Sim reminiscent of System Shock and Prey by the virtue of being set on a space station in the future. But here's a defining twist: this is a poltergeist simulator where you play as a disembodied consciousness, a marooned saboteur EGO, in a constant struggle to keep itself together. Your task is to find resource-effective solutions to a constant stream of creative problems while smuggling yourself through elaborate corporate security checkpoints in the middle of nowhere. This game's world is a sandbox done right, with you being the bucket and the spade. Here, player agency is king.<br><br><div class="bb_h3">Setting</div>The setting incorporates the humorous tone of Douglas Adams and the high-concept narrative of Stanislaw Lem. It's a touching story that poses morbid existential questions and an effortlessly humorous adventure full of cute robots and cerebral gags. The plot is delivered through notes and sparse monologues, dispensed by Dr. Everyman. "A bit cliché English professor", in his own words. Like you, your guide and mentor inhabits various machines. Being but a sack of fragmented memories at the start, you'll find out more than you bargained for by the end. For now, you can only HOP from thing to thing, which, in the long run, should allow you to take ctrl of the station back from some parasite. It's not like you have better plans for your clueless post-matter existence.<br><br><div class="bb_h3">Presentation</div>In appearances, this ain't your art deco, local environments sport a jagged utilitarian design. It grew on me after I had some time to absorb the cosmic contrast between saturated light and thick shadows as well as one tasteful retrofuturistic colour palette. Some might say the game looks technologically inferior, generic, and there's nothing more to it. But I find it ambiguously beautiful. Even if its presentation is a product of limitations, the result is positively Kubrickian, which accurately reflects the sci-fi framework in place.<br><br>The world of eccentric automaton freaks sounds cute until you bother them to the point when they start screeching and chasing you. One mistake sends you zipping around clanking corridors in panic, with menacing voices thundering from loudspeakers, professing your inevitable demise. With tensions so high, you need to listen to your surroundings to survive. Instead of music, local environments produce humming and buzzing of machinery. The dwelling robots have names, their beeps and cheeps make each type stand out. You could usually tell whom to expect long before turning a corner.<br><br>I appreciate the dev's commitment to include as many accessibility options as possible, yet I'd like to suggest a few additional QoL improvements. For one, the game could use a map. Some locations aren’t that visually distinct and there isn't always an antenna with a bird's-eye view to help with navigation. The hitboxes are accurate, but probably exceedingly so in places, leading to objects in the environment having sticky edges, obstructing movement. Finally, spoiling the overall impression, I've had unwarranted framedrops, especially by the end. Update: it got fixed. Done, now let's unpack the best stuff.<br><br><div class="bb_h3">Interfacing</div>You HOP between hosts by interfacing with their EGO sensors, taking ctrl over robots, opening doors, and signing into security networks. Juggling your hosts is a must, for none of them can do everything. One ctrls like a bumper car, another squeezes in tight spaces, and the other one is a tripod with a beam cannon. Each robot has its clumsy charm. They are distinguished by cute acronyms like MUM, GOD, PUP, breathing personality into the world. I'm sure GOD piqued your interest, but it's uncooperative. BUG 22 would be your main body, your upgradeable toolkit, and your only hope in this world. There's no space to describe every entity, so we'll settle for a holistic example.<br><br>The BUG I required was stuck in a locked crate between two BUG-repellent force fields on a module floating in space. I had to HOP into a MUM who was patrolling the module. MUMs are normally used to kill stuff and bypass security, but I only got her through the field to push buttons, unlocking the crate. On the roof of the module, stood a lonely DAD, a sentry that shoots a serialising beam I required. I took ctrl of him and used a SHIFT beam to throw the old git through the field. There, DAD serialised the BUG, which meant that its data got stored in his memory. But the slacker can't do much else, even move, so I used MUM again to push DAD out into space where he printed the BUG for me.<br><br>Performing such tricks will soon become second nature. Use your cards right and feel like the smartest bot in the room. Be reckless - and face an out-of-hand cascade, leading to your temporary demise. Instead of immediately losing after your host has been broken or serialised, you get a chance to ctrl something else in the vicinity during your disembodied state. From that position, you can always reprint your property using a BUG Printer device or HOP into a thing that serialised you and rescue the body. Hold your horses, though! Killing or seizing stuff comes at a price. Your options are vast, but restricted by certain resources.<br><br><div class="bb_h3">Egonomics</div>Time to talk Egonomics. Just a few things to wrap your head around first. There're 6 pickups: Juice (fuel for abilities), batteries (HP), EGO fragments, Worms, Disks, and MEMs. Use a MEM with an Augmentation Terminal to raise your HOP speed, make enemies less observant, etc. Put a Disc in a BUG to install a permanent ability of your choice, then find Worms to upgrade those. Using that system, equip your BUG with different arms, rocket boosters, invisibility, and other cool stuff. With that, go to town or go virtual, reprint yourself on the other side of an obstacle course or a fence, drop bombs, and fly away.<br><br>All hosts have EGO ratings, to ctrl them you need to spend an according amount of EGO that can be found in the wild or by hopping into certain stuff that stores it. There's more than enough EGO scattered around the place, but not so much that you could mindlessly cut through the majority of predicaments, overriding and destroying everything. The going gets tough by the midgame, save up. I was always barely scraping by, yet that didn't diminish the fun I had, making me find unorthodox solutions to problems instead of throwing EGO at them. Granted, the EGO poverty stemmed from me stupidly doing just that when I had plenty.<br><br>There's enough Juice if you don't always go guns blazing. Despite some great gunplay with powerful feedback and headshots in slow motion, brute force lacks unless used along with other skills. For what's a shotgun blast when you can shift things around at will, reprint yourself to skip obstacles, or turn any object into a bomb? Even if you crave total carnage, you'll still find a variety of possible abilities irreplaceable. Something new always impedes your progress, it's a challenging ordeal. But most of all - a gratifying endeavour. If you like imaginative secrets hidden across interconnected environments, you've come to the right place.<br><br><div class="bb_h3">End</div>I opted for the second hardest difficulty because it gives enemies recharging health without making them too tanky. I wanted to keep the option to go Rambo. Like Rambo, I had to sneak and plan my ambushes carefully to single out my prey or break several robots in quick succession. I failed a lot. I don't mind, but that difficulty setting may seem too frantic for some. Keep this in mind in case you want a relaxed playthrough. Mine wasn't, but I enjoyed every minute of it. The colossal ambition behind this sleeper hit is staggering. Its fun conundrums came to be unique and captivating. At the end of the day, Ctrl Alt Ego is a contemplative experience that ambushes you with its penetrating narrative and sharp design.<br><br>My curator <a class="bb_link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/curator/35305390-Big-Bad-Mutuh/?appid=262060" target="_blank" rel="">Big Bad Mutuh</a>			</div>

																Game presents you with a simulated environment, where almost every element is interactible. It presents you a sandbox, and then offers numerous tools to achieve your goals whichever way you want. It's reminiscent of immersive sims like System Shock, but instead of focusing on rpg-like character progression (the way most modern sims went) it leans more into puzzle-game-like territory, with one major difference - the focus is not, (like in for example Portal) to figure out the one right solution. The game pushes you to employ your creativity instead, making it, i feel, the most similar to Thief 1/Thief 2 in how it encourages you to experiment with tools at your disposal. The most prominent is the ability to possess objects - both enemies, and things like computers or doors,  with possessions giving you different opportunities. <br><br>There is still a character progression system in place, in form of BUG-s, multipurpose bots you can upgrade with collectible floppy disks, giving them new tools such as ability to fly or shoot, a tool that works as a vacuum cleaner, or telekinesis. This system can however be safely ignored if one wishes to do so. There is even an achievement for finishing the game with no BUG upgrades - open ended level design means there are a lot of ways to achieve your goals with minimal BUG usage.<br><br>I really enjoy the voice acting and writing - it's both funny (my favourite so far being "wrong kind of emu" pun) and engaging (for example, every possessed object can introduce themselves to you, giving you both engaging bits of worldbuilding and presenting a kind of personality) <br><br>It's worth mentioning how the game rewards exploration. A lot of optional places require you to be creative with how you get inside, and reward you with collectibles that actually feel rewarding - each one has their use, unlike with collectibles in some mainstream games. There are already mentioned floppy disks, but also EGO points you can use for possessing enemies, and many more i won't list here.			</div>

																Probably the best immersive sim of 2022 was made by a team of two devs. Ctrl Alt Ego has everything one's looking for in the genre: <br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Wide range of available playstyles: sneaky, stabby, hacky, mind controlly, shooty.<br></li><li>Solid amount of skills and perks with a range of customization options.<br></li><li>Graphics straight out of the early 2000s to remind one of the genre classics.<br></li><li>Dystopian future on a derelict space station. <br></li><li>Early Doctor Who aesthetics.  <br></li><li>15-20ish hour campaign that doesn't overstay its welcome. Later levels offer fun and spoilery gimmicks. <br></li><li>Viable option of accepting one's screwups and carrying on with the consequences instead of rapid save scumming (which is also an option)</li></ul>On a more important note, the game offers 44 achievements each with its own unique cat photo used as an art thumbnail. You heard that right, folks: 44 cute cat photos for the low, low price of $19.99 or your regional equivalent! It's a barkin' bargain!			</div>

																I'm completely blown away that this entire thing was made by just two people. I normally don't review games, but since I completely lucked into finding this game I'm leaving a review in hopes that it helps more people find it. <br><br>This was a surprisingly long (my first playthrough was a hair over 13 hours), absolutely incredible immersive sim wrapped up in a funny "you're in a computer" style world. The core loop has you transferring your consciousness through various entities around the world to gain access to new areas/defeat enemies/read "eyepads"/etc, but you'll spend most of your time in a robot called Bug 22. They're the only bug with a disk drive and therefore the only one that can accept upgrades.<br><br>The upgrades are all available from the start so it's up to you to decide which you want first. I know I missed a few upgrade disks in my playthrough but I still managed to get every upgrade. You can also power up each upgrade with "worms" to reduce to cost to use or increase the effectiveness or even otherwise enhance the upgrades.<br><br>Aesthetically the game isn't going to win any awards. It's consistent and everything fits within this world, but don't expect AAA sub-surface scattering and ray tracing. Don't let the visuals distract you from the absolutely incredible gameplay, however.<br><br>The story was surprisingly good, touching on the nature of consciousness without taking itself too seriously. There were a lot of inside-programming/IT jokes (merging commits, visiting the cloud via port 80, bad password management, etc.). I also really enjoyed how the controls actually were part of the joke: in order to take "control" of other entities, you push CTRL; if you want to "shift" objects around, you push SHIFT; to download an "alternate" version of yourself (aka teleport) you use ALT.<br><br>I really appreciated how if you were thorough you could discover many different solutions to the same problem. For example to get through a locked door, you might find a vent that only a certain type of robot can fit through to get around it, but the vent is blocked by a heavy box that you can move (if you have the right upgrade) or destroy (if you have the right upgrade, or you could take control of a hostile robot to use their weapon to remove the box), or you can use the grate on the ceiling (if you have boosters), or you could take control of a camera and jump around from entity to entity to try to get an angle on the door lock and open it from the other side. <br><br>According to the achievements the entire game should be playable without any upgrades, completely pacifist, or ghost. I was not skilled enough to do any of those, but it's a sign of a quality immersive sim that those are all available.<br><br>I'll definitely be coming back to this to try levels again with different tools.<br><br>tl;dr: I wholeheartedly recommend this to anyone who is a fan of the immersive sim genre.			</div>

																As an obnoxious immersive sim enthusiast I learned of this game a while ago but kept sleeping on it as I did with other immersive sims like Dishonored 2. After I burned out hauling cargo for 100 hours straight I decided I'd finally pick this one up since some folks in my imsim sphere have likened it to the OG Deus Ex which was an intriguing prospect. How does it fare?<br><br>Well, this might be one of the best imsims I've played in recent memory on a purely mechanical level. The core mechanic of jumping from machine to machine using the power of possession in such large sandbox-esque levels, coupled with various tools you can equip to your core 'Bug' along with upgrades in the form of 'Worms' creates a whole realm of possible solutions to the scenarios laid out in front of you. I was having an absolute blast flexing my brain trying to figure out how to solve the puzzles, and marvelling at my own creativity when I come up with something completely outlandish which as various notes in the game will tell, was definitely intended by the developer. If you think you broke the game, you probably didn't (unless you clipped through a wall and fell out of bounds which I think is probably one of the few things that wasn't intended)<br><br>As for the story, it gets very philosophical and I'm not smart enough to fully understand the ideas talked about in the game, since I tend to think more mechanically in games and don't have much luck analysing a story beyond "good guy good, bad guy bad." I also really enjoyed the music in the game because hilariously, every interactable object in this game has its own theme music and some tracks in particular were so good I bought the soundtrack. The humour in this game is very British, and the main character you interact with throughout the story seems very likeable and has an interesting backstory, but I would recommend you just play through the game to experience this because it definitely should be played.<br><br>This game also presents an interesting idea behind the whole concept of an immersive sim, in that they can essentially be seen as puzzle games where a puzzle may have various different answers. Do you shotgun the problem, do you drill the problem into tiny pieces, do you telekinetically throw the problem around the room until its solved? Do you possess the problem and hop between different aspects of the problem until you reach the solution? Just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ play this game then because if you see yourself as a creative problem solver in games then this is definitely for you.<br><br>So yeah, S tier immersive sim and hugely underrated, huge recommendation to those who enjoy the genre.			</div>

																Initially intriguing and entertaining concept which becomes repetitive and miserable towards the end of the game. I was really rushing to finish it towards the end because I knew if I put it down, I would never pick it up again and finish it. I did finish it on moderate difficulty. In the end it was a lot less than I was expecting in terms of gameplay. <br><br>From hearing positive reviews of the game and seeing the trailers, what I was expecting was a lot different than what I got...<br><br>Be aware it is a rather linear, level-based progression through levels with puzzles that have clearly designed-for solutions. It was a lot more like a puzzle game than something more open-ended and dynamic. Yes, there are numerous approaches to puzzles and numerous ways to deal with enemies but I didn't really see this as a contributor to the fun of the game. Each of the options I tried never felt that fun to me, sometimes were even frustrating. Once your build has gone down a certain path you will generally be doing that for the rest of the game, too. The game didn't seem to reward or encourage variety and experimentation outside of the player getting bored. <br><br>The premise of the game makes it seem like you might be controlling and coordinating a variety of unique devices, possibly coordinating them in parallel like a hybrid RTS, maybe eventually amassing an army, but that's not at all what it is. You will basically be spending most of your time controlling only one bot, Bug 22, as that's the bot that receives all of the upgrades. You never have multiple Bugs that have upgrades active at once, any other Bugs you find basically do nothing. Coordinating multiple things is basically not feasible and pointless since your bot is strong enough to take everything on its own. Other than that actual controllable units, it is basically just static devices you possess to gain ego points, view an area, or read text. Generally, nothing you control needs to be brought between areas. No point as there will always be more.<br><br>If there was more to do with those static devices that would be cool, but as it stands the game might honestly be better without them. <br><br>As for the controllable units other than Bug 22, basically there is just PUP, MUM, and DAD. Pup is for small vents and annoyingly has to be carried in hand as a physical object - you can't "store" him in inventory and take him with you. Especially annoying as he clacks against everything and you get stuck on objects when trying to carry him around. Just trust me, you will learn to hate it. Mum moves and shoots and was kill on sight for me, the ability it has to freeze and let you carry enemies was never something I needed. Dad is basically a turret but can also zap objects to store them and materialize them which I used in a few puzzles. And that's basically it for controllable units. After I was comfortable enough with melee, mum and dad were basically always kill on sight. And none of them really act autonomously once you control them so they are basically siting ducks.<br><br>I ended up going with a melee build, using the disassembler (drill) and VaQ to efficiently defeat enemies. It worked and I was able to conserve a lot of resources and progress quickly, but I had often frustrating issues with melee hit registration where enemies weren't taking damage when I was drilling right on them (this was mostly an issue with the flying enemies). Once I saw the various options for dealing with enemies this seemed like the least annoying, and even then it was annoying. The melee can destroy enemies before they even aggro you, and the VaQ replenishes your oil and health so you can keep meleeing. At the end I had amassed several unspent skill points which would let me unlock new abilities and I didn't even use them as nothing seemed interesting or useful and what I was doing worked fine. I stayed FAR away from any ability that looked like I might need to carry and throw things as that doesn't work well AT ALL in this game's physics engine and cramped rooms. If the rooms were a bit more spacious I could see those things working out better, but alas. <br><br>Combat is annoying but easier than trying to sneak around. Easier to kill everything first generally. You will either spend ego to use enemies to destroy other enemies (or ctrl them to make them not a threat) or destroy them directly via combat from your main bug.<br><br>I had some frustrating repetitive moments of dying or getting spotted and reloading. The game tells you you can just spend ego to resurrect your bot but why bother when you could just reload, plus you don't know how much ego you should be saving.<br><br>Ego jumping gets really tedious, fast. You need to ego jump to open doors and to save and to collect the primary resource of the game. You do this a LOT. These things should've just been a button press.<br><br>The game is sometimes inconsistent with what must be done via ego jumping vs switches/buttons. I kept forgetting that switches were even a thing, which led to me getting stuck on some sections as I was looking for things which were ego-jumpable<br><br>The game does a bad job in some places with signifiers. A lot of the "challenge" of making progress is just noticing things that you need to progress and the game makes them annoyingly hard to notice at times, resulting in tedious pixel hunting. Tiny switches which have to be manually pressed despite 90% of things being activated by ego jumping, ego-jumpable things which don't highlight in ego mode despite looking right at them, and vent grates or openings which are really dark and not highlighted by the level design. In some cases there are things that visually look like vent openings but which are not openable.<br><br>Performance is really bad on the last area, which you will spend quite a bit of time in. Getting frequent sub-15 FPS in certain areas. I wanted to spend more time exploring this area but performance was so bad I didn't bother.<br><br>About 1/3 into the game you have basically seen all there is in terms of gameplay outside of some additional abilities you can get which basically just give you different ways to destroy enemies and then some really annoying flying enemies introduced later that kill you near instantly if the physics engine decides to not be on your side. Those enemies really aren't fun to deal with and can't even be possessed and due to how much they move around, seem to screw with the melee hit detection. <br><br>I would've been totally fine if the game ended like 2 chapters earlier. But then it just kept going on and on and there was nothing there in the game that inspired me to want to keep playing other than the hope of some new stuff or variety that never came.<br><br>With all these issues, there is plenty the game does right. My favorite aspect is the quirky dialogue, writing and story, and the design of the different units is cute as well. But in terms of the moment to moment gameplay, I started to get sick of it halfway through.			</div>

																Immersive sims are such a rarity to find and are only recently having resurgence via the indie scene. Ctrl Alt Ego however already feels like it can stand out from the old and new due to what if focuses on.<br><br>Combat and/or stealth tend to be the bread and butter for this genre (Thief, System Shock, Deus Ex, etc.). While CAE offers systems to accommodate both play styles, every encounter is designed around feeling more puzzle oriented as CAE's big gameplay mechanic involves the player being able to take control of objects and robots around the environment and swap between one another for different uses. Your "main" robot of sorts known as the "BUG", also gains an assortment of unlockable programs (aka, Deus Ex styled augmentations) and each having a respective sub skills to spec into (all of which is dependent on how much the player explores the levels and find collectibles for upgrading). All of this is wrapped up on top of simple but effective resource management systems around a "juice" meter (how much energy you have to use one of your many programs), "EGO" (a cost requirement to possess enemy robots), and a fully physics based environment with many throwable objects.<br><br>The game fully offers lethal and non-lethal solutions to anything in the game which not only affects the build the player goes for but also a long term mentality around solving puzzles. A lethal player wouldn't have to worry about wandering enemies but will have to deal with the constant need to search for resources to refill juice and health around the environment as well as losing any possession opportunities a different robot can give. A non-lethal play style gives the player more opportunities for subterfuge and saving on juice but at the potential cost of using more EGO for possession and needing to pre-plan a lot more around the environment to minimize direct confrontations (such as setting up walls of barrels and crates to hide enemy sight lines). This isn't even considering factors such as a stealthy or a rush kind of approach, a completionist mentality, or even self-inflicted challenges such as a no program run (meaning you have to entirely rely on the environment to go through levels). Changing up playstyles and builds really feels like a different experience instead of just a different coat of paint here.<br><br>There's a ton more to compliment about the game than just this aspect (the claustrophobic yet open level design, the dry humor, the mission select that allows players to easily revisit chapters they completed to test out different playstyles without needing to start up the entire campaign again, QoL like being able to know what collectibles are leftover in an area before leaving, the fact that every achievement are cat pictures, etc.) but the aspect above is what I wanted to emphasize the most because the advertising might lead people to thinking it's just a game with a neat gimmick around it. It's a game with about as much depth as any other immersive sim to compare it to and it would be a shame for a game this good to not get the proper recognition it deserves. Especially at the price point relative to the amount of content and replayability on display, this is something any immersive sim fan and puzzle game fan should try out.			</div>

																This game is absolutely incredible. If you do not play it, you are hurting yourself. I have never played an immersive sim that provides a sandbox as large. I genuinely feel like you could put 100 people in a room and have them play this game from start to finish, and not a single one of them will have completed each encounter/objective in the same way. I heard this game was good, but ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, I did not expect it to be this good. Everything in this game is a puzzle, and you are able to solve each puzzle in so many ways it baffles me. Do yourself a favor and buy this game.			</div>

																Great game, holds up well against other imsims. Really flexed my creativity, and it wasn't until I realized that I wasn't going for a pacifist run that I really opened up.<br><br>Goodness, I already feel nostalgic for the early levels. <br><br>If you're playing on Strict, enemies regen their health fairly quickly, so it's a game of "you come at the king, you best not miss." Which actually isn't THAT difficult; you can do a lot of damage with a fair bit of preparation. This ain't your pappy's wave shooter, you gotta scout out your enemies, see if they've got any supporting healers, hack the healers, isolate your prey. Lock them in a transparent room of containers. May be tempted to scratch at the walls, make them know fear, but that'll activate their onboard shields, making it that much harder. No, the prison is the FINAL step in executing these lesser beings. The moment they glanced even the slightest hint that something was wrong was the last moment of their pathetic life. They bump into the box to get around it, boom. Box blows up, rest of the walls blow up, they blow up, you blow up, you load a save and take a few steps back beforehand, they blow up, you rush in with a shotgun and cap their head clean off, then cannibalize their "corpse" for that sweet, sweet fuel.<br><br>Lesser difficulties you'll have great success chucking boxes and explosive barrels at people, no tricks, edit: on strict+, I said they'd heal up by the time you can grab a second barrel, but that's only if they detect you first. I've been having a lot more success just by planning the tosses, timing them when they look away.<br><br>I also ended with well over 200 ego stashed away, so as long as you're not "wasting" it with excessive revives, you'll not need to fret too hard over currency. All in all, this is a great game worth your time and worth your mind.			</div>

																This game was actually surprising to me as by the end I realized it became my favorite Immersive Sim out of the many I've played.<br><br>Starting off the gameplay is really diverse and honestly impressive on how you can go about doing things. You as the player are an Ego who can control any device with a sensor, therefore using it as your host, and that can help you scout out what is in a room, or use an enemy robot to infiltrate in places without triggering any hostiles and maybe even taking out your enemies before you move in your bug. Speaking of which, Bug 22 is your main host as it is the only host you can upgrade utilizing disks, those upgrades can range from ego (a resource you need to ctrl other robots, locked doors, keypads, etc.) sucker, aeronautics that allow you fly, shotgun, etc. which all offer you even more ways of tackling the situations the game gives you, furthermore, these uprgades can be improved using Worms that you can find plenty across the games areas.<br><br>Level design is good and really reminds me of Prey and System Shock games (one of the best immersive sims imo), as well as the whole game reminds me of them. It is separated into 3 facilities all with their zones which you load into, and there are various ways to move through these zones which may even let you avoid any kind of conflict at all, which helps you save your resources. Something else that surprised me was the length, I was scared that it'd be a quick game but I was surprised to say that I spent a good 12 hours in-game which was enjoyable from start to finish.<br><br>The story is unique I'd say, you can uncover points of the plot aswell as foreshadowings at any order basically. You also have a man named Dr. David Everyman who guides you across the CRS and tells you information about a few things, but not everything, to obtain more information you must read the note pads scattered across the games all telling you different aspects of the place you're in aswell as the people that once were there. Something I'd like to add is that the antagonist really reminds me of SHODAN if it's voice were of a male, and it really sounds intimidating and imposing although too loud.<br><br>Overall, I'd say this is the best game I've played this year and I can tell the developer(s) really put effort into this to make it feel like an authentic Immersive Sim taking inspiration from its predecessors my only complaint really is that the antagonist sounds too loud and the only other issue I've had were cases of the Bug being outside the map when I ctrl'd it after going far away from it aswell as when downloading it too close to a corner. I'd also like to point out how active the developer, Mindthunk, is be it in their twitter or the steam forum of the game, responding to every question a player may have about the game and even taking their suggestions for future updates, I believe that is the sign of a great developer who listen to it's players that want to improve the game. I give it a 10/10 and definitely a GOTY for me			</div>

																This game should be way more popular!<br>+ The level of freedom is like nothing else I've ever seen, it's not just "you can go stealth or berserk" type crap - you're given a goal and it's totally up to you how you achieve it<br>+ Great humor reminding me of Wheatley from Portal 2<br>+ Many immersive sims have a problem with save scumming. In Ctrl Alt Ego, death is a part of the experience, and it's so masterfully crafted you wouldn't want it any other way - you never get mad when you die as it always opens up even more possibilities.<br>+ Multiple shortcuts and other secrets to uncover<br>+ Cats<br><br>The only issue I had was with performance, which wasn't the best the last time I tried it, so I had to turn resolution down from 3440x1440 to 2560x1080 to get good framerates... but a performance update hit Steam just 2 days ago, so it may very well be better now. Finally an excuse for me to play again :)<br><br>Just go play it!! You won't be disappointed I promise!<br><br>Edit: indeed performance is WAY better after the update!			</div>

																Wonderful game! This is one of those games where I'm sad when it ends because I enjoyed playing it so much. As a little robot exploring a space station there's so much to do and manipulate. It's all very fun figuring out clever ways to complete your tasks, collecting things, controlling other robots and finding secret stuff. I also very much enjoyed the humor sprinkled throughout the game. Take your time with this game, don't just run through it you'll miss so much.			</div>

																My playtime on record undersells how long I've played. I spent maybe 6-8 hours on the Demo before release. This game is SO good, it rocks my world, I need to set aside more time to play it. I'm trying so hard not to ramble because I got a veritable flood of happy brain chemicals from the game. <b>TLDR</b> this game has all the features I want it to have, I consider it a diamond in the rough.<br><br>The core mechanic, "hopping" between hosts, is awesome. It may look like a psychedelic trip in the screenshots but it's quite smooth. You use this to find all sorts of vantage points and solve puzzles, resulting in great "a-ha!" moments. It goes hand-in-hand with the exploration that is also incredibly rewarding. <br><br>The exploration is great. The levels are big, but not overwhelmingly so. You are not picking up everyone's crap like in a Bethesda game, but the environment is just as interactable. There are about 4 types of items for you to find: your hp/energy pickups, which I have no trouble keeping topped up all the time; and disks and worms, which you spend on permanent upgrades. Each of these upgrade "paths", there are around 8 I think, promises a unique power for you to use. I went straight for the flight power which later upgrades to include a "ramming" ability, which is pretty fun.<br><br>Physics objects are all over the place for you to use in creative ways. (i.e. for navigation or combat) It reminds me of my limited knowledge of Half Life. Don't be put off by the cliche of "x meets y" when the store page references Portal, there really is a strong brain-bending element to this game that rewards ingenuity. You know how in Zelda you get a key item every dungeon and then all the remaining puzzles are obvious? Well, this game's approach to environmental puzzles and permanent upgrades is like a more clever spin on that, since the various tools can be used for various problems, it's not a 1-to-1.<br><br>There are pacifist, killer, and total stealth objectives. There is a clear outline of how to achieve these challenges (actually the tutorial system and new player experience is good overall) and a tracker at the end of each level, so when you reach the tracker, you can go back and get the bits you missed. I am REALLY curious to see some challenge runs, maybe that mix-n-match the playstyle challenge with other restrictions. You really can "play the game your way", something that is often promised but almost never delivered.<br><br>Your goal is basically to clear the level by reaching various sub-objectives. But despite being a game full of robots, there is nothing robotic about this, as you are constantly treated to humorous quips from the (somewhat sentient?) bots you inhabit. There is some really good voice acting that helps brings the world to life. We get humorous names for technology in this world like DADs and CATs. Though the themes are kinda serious, the experience is whimsical too. I got tired of being an edgy assassin boi in Dishonored/Deus Ex, or being deeply alone with the dead in Prey 2017. No, this game has more room for lightheartedness in its fun, I think.<br><br>I came for the gameplay, stayed for that plus everything else. It is obviously gameplay-first so I was impressed by the depth of everything beyond those technical aspects. This is clearly a passion project, and I'm in awe of it, I hope maybe I can make something similarly inspiring one day. Give it a try if you like its contemporaries or you are just curious, you won't regret it!<br><br>**EDIT the Hop animation can be toned down if it's too intense. dev has been great with adding features and bugfixes in patch.			</div>

																<div class="bb_h1">A Fantastic Game, With Some Rough Edges</div><br>EDIT: I have been in contact with the developer over the suggestions and bugs that i experienced and while we had understandable disagreements over some, all of them have been at least discussed. the suggestion list has been updated to show what has and has not changed<br><br>In short, Ctrl Alt Ego is a great game with a unique concept, executed brilliantly, and a worthy buy. The body hopping mechanic combined with its immersive sim elements allows for the player to make up creative solutions to problems on the fly, with each robot's strengths and weaknesses complimenting one another to ensure that there is no one solution that becomes a dominant strategy (at least for now in my playthrough)<br><br>The level design, while not starting off on its best foot, really starts hitting high points as soon as you get through the levels that were available in the demo, with a ton of really clever moments, especially when attempting to play pacifist.<br><br>However, some design decisions and/or oversights have left me annoyed at times, and while they are in no way dealbreakers, i feel like i should at least point them out, in a hope that the developer gives an update to the game to make any future players lives just that bit better <br><br>For context, i am attempting a pacifist/ghost playthough, very slight spoilers ahead, mostly mechanical not story<br><br><br><b>THE ISSUES/GRIEVANCES THAT I HAVE HAD, ORDERED BY HOW EASY THEY COULD BE SOLVED</b><br><br>- The stats screens are treated like the unimportant bots in that you can only hop to them when very close, which is quite annoying when you just accidentally exploded a room full of bug traps and are trying to find out if you added to your bots broken counter (FIXED)<br>- Letting the player know that attempting to use a locked door, while controlling a bot that has the key, wont actually let you unlock the door will help alleviate the disappointment for when they actually try (FIXED, Controlling dads that have keys allow you to open locked doors)<br>- Bug bots do not explode when thrown or have object thrown at them, but explode when landed on by non bugs, which is an annoying lack of consistency ( DISCUSSED, was me being dumb)<br>- There appear to be some holes in the sound design, most notably being DAD's that make AFAIK no sound at all when idle, even when turning, leading to too many situations of me going into a room looking around for friendlies to get ego from, and next thing i know theres a DAD beam hitting me in the back. on top of that, it would be really really helpful if the enemies made some kind of windup sound indicating when theyre gonna change direction, because there is otherwise no way to tell when an enemy is going to turn if they are turning from a dead stop (cameras, DAD's, etc) (DISCUSSED, on the todo list (?))<br>- The delay on changing direction when controlling MOM's is really annoying, and doesnt even make sense when changing direction by moving the camera holds no penalty (FIXED)<br>- The hexagonal projection given off by cameras seems unhelpful at letting you determine the actual boundaries of its vision (DISCUSSED, unchanged, not much of a real issue)<br>- The wobbling of your aim when firing a MOM's beam feels unfair when your enemies fire at you with perfect aim (FIXED)<br>- Please include the bother meter for enemies while controlling unsafe bots. I think that the scrambled ego perk has some effect on unsafe bots, but am unsure. regardless, there have been a couple too many times where i am in line of sight of a bot, they arent reacting to me, i think im in the clear, and then all of a sudden they can see me. (DISCUSSED not planned to change, but noted)<br>- When engaging with an enemy, there have been a couple of occasions where it just has not been obvious that they are being healed by a matterboy which means you cannot win. I would suggest a change to the enemy energy bar that shows not only are they currently being healed by a matterboy, but that there is a matterboy nearby pre fight, so you dont get into a dad fight only to find out that you literally cannot win (DISCUSSED, not planned to change, but added the feature that lets you put matterboys in auto mode)<br>- Virtual program counts 'warning' as 'being attacked', which again was disappointing to find out. I would actually suggest splitting the upgrade that lets you go invisible while under attack into 2 parts; a 1 worm upgrade that lets you go invisible while enemy is in 'warning' state, and a 2 worm upgrade that lets you go invisible while being actually attacked (FIXED, no longer considers warning as being attacked) <br>- The ego drain function is way too expensive, and is basically useless stock. Keeping it as is while making it cheaper would be broken tho, so i propose that a new upgrade tree be added that determines how much ego you can drain off a single target, starting at 10% of their starting ego, then going 25% 50% and 65%, with the worm cost of the whole program readjusted to accommodate (DISCUSSED, not changed, but ego drain being faster being considered)<br>- Picking up objects feels kind of unfinished, and for whatever reason the thing your holding will just occasionally decide its not being held anymore , which is really not fun when the thing youre holding is an impact explosive (FIXED)<br>- Even with filters, selecting what bot to control while in ego mode is just Not A Good Experience. More often than not it treats where youre looking as mere suggestion that it can prompty ignore while it selects a bot thats halfway off the screen and 100 meters away. On top of that friendly bots are often completely ignored when not exclusively filtering for them, and even then it takes a lot for the game to decide to reveal some of them (FIXED for the most part, selecting object more biased towards the middle of the screen)<br>- On both of the levels available in the demo, i attempted to do a clean sweep for the achievement, but in both cases could not find 1 ego remaining in the level, and going around and around a level with a fine tooth comb leads me to believe that either this is a bug and i did find everything, or the final object in both levels is unreasonably difficult to find. In either case, a nice quality of life improvement would be giving the emu itself a skilltree that let you narrow down the remaining bits of friendly ego, and possibly other collectables. (DISCUSSED a sort of unlockable ego radar for future playthroughs is on the todo list)<br>- Remote Debugging could have done with a complete redesign. Launch control sufferes a bit from this too, but Remote Debugging <i>really</i> feels like a level from a demo that was made months before the rest of the levels and never got revisited. Ideally the first levels of the game should be the last levels you make, as it means youre putting your best foot forward. But having a linear corridor with the same stationary enemy over and over again is not exactly what i would call 'your best foot forward', which is really a shame because like i mentioned this game past that point has some REALLY good level design, and it would be a shame if someone got turned off from the demo because the last moment they had in it was just going through a corridor and never picking up the full release (DISCUSSED understandably not going to happen)<br><br>To anyone that got through this to the end, please note that none of these are real deal breakers (and now most of these have been fixed!), and that the  game easily justifies the price (especially during the opening week sale) and i am Absolutely having fun with it, its just that as a hobbyist imsim game dev myself (coming soon 2090), i cant help but notice some things that i felt the need to speak up on, if only to try to help			</div>

																<div class="bb_h1">This is the best immersive sim since Prey and a GOTY contender for 2022.</div> If that is the sentence you were waiting for to buy this, there you go. <br><br>For everyone else that is not a huge fan of the genre,  this game is a masterclass in emergent gameplay and will reward every ounce of your creativity. It is CRIMINAL how little promotion this got from gaming media in general, and I would urge you to give this gem a chance - trust me, I can count on one hand how many games allow me to teleport replicating nukes on my enemies, and all of them are great.			</div>

																<b>100% yes!</b><br><br>This is a delightful immersive sim, featuring a compelling variety of abilities and approaches, a 'fail forward' design (though you can use traditional save/load if you want!), and a charming, idiosyncratic setting.  Exploration and completionism are rewarded with more resources and ability development, but a more focused approach can certainly succeed as well; with skillful play all critical challenges are completable without ANY upgrades or special resources.  There are several difficulty levels to provide a substantially tougher experience, or a more dialed back, relaxing romp.<br><br>Special care has been taken in the design to specifically support the classic immersive sim trinity of violence, pacifism, or stealth, with special achievements available for completing a level with any of these playstyles.  Helpful scoreboards within the game let you know how many resources are left to find, how many enemies are left to defeat, how many times you've been detected, etc.  Again, none of this is mandatory for completing the game and I found for my first run-through that a constant mix of styles was most fun for me.<br><br>The abilities available have great variety and may be learned in any order.  If you want your very first special power to be invisibility, that can be your first upgrade.  Flight?  Teleportation?  Implosion bombs?  Telekinesis?  These and other skills are slowly learned one by one and beg to be used in creative combination to evade, destroy, or turn threats over to your side.  Additionally, each upgrade can itself be improved with sufficient resources; your melee drill might gain increased reach, or your shield might become more energy efficient.  You can focus on improving just a few upgrades to high levels, boost everything for more versatility, or eschew them altogether for a real challenge.<br><br><i>Ctrl Alt Ego</i>'s central gameplay mechanic is also its most unique: the power to possess and ctrl almost any unit or electronic item in the game!  If you can't open a locked door, perhaps you can project your consciousness <i>through</i> it and take command of a security camera on the other side.  Then, from that vantage point, examine the room visually and dominate an enemy robot previously hidden, and use its access to open the door for you, or even achieve your objective without opening the door at all!  Often, enemies of superior strength can be turned against one another to great effect.  Of course, each approach has its own costs as well as advantages.<br><br>The pacing of the game is wonderful, with varying tasks to perform, several enemy types to learn, convoluted level design that demands player attention to navigate, and a story at once humorous, tragic, and bizarre.  I won't spoil anything here, but there were a few turns taken that surprised me, and made me respect the writing and design even more than already expressed.<br><br>The main campaign at the default difficulty level took me about 25 hours to finish, with a "trying to find the all secrets but not being too crazy about it" level of completionism.  I can always go back and play again at higher difficulty if I REALLY want to find every last worm and ego fragment.  For now, I'm very satisfied with my playthrough and the length felt just right.  The game took a good solid investment to finish but never wore out its welcome.<br><br>This is a masterfully crafted imsim and if what I've said here sounds at all interesting to you, don't wait for a sale.  $20 is a steal for such a challenging, engaging, entertaining, and substantial piece of work.			</div>

																Nota 9: Excelente. A idéia de assumir outros corpos e com isso ter acesso a diferentes habilidades, me lembrou um pouco do Space Station Silicon Valley (N64). É um jogo inteligente, que mostra que para inovar é preciso correr riscos, e que em um videogame, as mecânicas são mais importantes do que os gráficos. Uma grande surpresa e digno de ser incluído no rol dos melhores "immersive sims".			</div>

																Наткнулся на мега-позитивный обзор этого immersive sim у Charlatan Wonder и решил сразу купить, потому что хороших immersive sim днем с огнем не сыщешь, как говорится.<br><br>Действительно необычный проект, который идет по знакомым тропам immersive-геймплея, внося при этом очень свою механику перемещения между объектами/персонажами.<br><br>Самое близкое с чем могу сравнить - это первый System Shock, в первую очередь за счет механик апгрейда своего персонажа (единственное тут вроде выключать апгрейды нельзя, если купил то до конца).<br>Ну и любой другой immersive sim с подходом "вот уровень, цель ясна, приступай в любой последовательности и любыми методам".<br><br>Круто, самобытно, постоянно интригует, хочется искать секретные проходы, хочется попробовать все апгрейды, все какое-то значимое, игровой процесс ощутимо меняется вместе с тем как ты сам понимаешь "как можно играть", и как прокачиваешь персонажа.<br><br>Единственное, как по мне, так в концовке стало слишком много угроз и врагов на карте, и только поэтому в этот раз я игру точно не закончу. Жаль, потому что финальная локация вот прям тру, много этажей, полная свобода перемещения.<br>Ну и будто карты не хватает.<br><br>14 часов полностью погруженным в процесс я от нее получил.			</div>

																本测评已部分过时，且作者因为无法承受3D眩晕已无力继续完成游戏补完测评，如有了解游戏的需求请参阅sinnoware的测评。<br><br>目前玩完了第三章，因为太晕先写个评测，优点：<br>1.综合类机关图多，解法丰富。<br>2.主控机体能力可拓展性还算不错，dad最好；bug看起来能力多但比较平庸；pup的作用可替代性比较强，也有作为无聊的唯一解出现的时候；mum看起来后期能组成军队？这个有点意思。<br><br>但缺乏测试反馈带来了相当多细节上的问题：<br>1.滑行移动方式和粗劣的光影渲染的组合造就了前所未有的3D眩晕<br>2.fault能力制造的炸弹是否爆炸可能取决于碰撞动量，但动量阈值调得太低了以至于经常出现被门卡住——炸弹爆炸、慢速行进——炸弹爆炸等影响游戏体验的情况<br>3.第三章的关卡设计相比于一二章极速下滑。一二章虽然仍存在空间可推断性弱、缺少破序结构等问题，但仍是具有复杂结构的连通迷宫，而第三章就是一个标准的寻物环形潜行关卡，寻物还做得非常线性<br>4.过度强调跃迁这一核心能力的作用。但滥用跃迁在有些互动元件上是画蛇添足，比如电梯按钮；又缺乏更深层次的互动，比如移动可跃迁元件搭建网络（目前只知道使用dad移动其他机器人一种方法）<br>5.相当多的互动元件无拓展能力，只是收集ego和视野寻物的工具——但必须强调的是，大家来找茬并不有趣，收集ego也不应当作为玩家游玩时脑子里思考的目标。<br>6.可怕的地图加载频率，只有半条命可堪比拟。<br>7.对了，补充一点：如无限制距离飞行之类的暴力解法给得太早甚至可以说是第一章的强制需求（竖直梯子爬不上去得靠飞行飞上去也有点......虽说从合理性上讲可以观察到bug的足部是悬浮推进器不能爬梯子很合理，但这也太反直觉了，第一章找到回转路线发现是原本爬不上去的梯子时我甚至觉得有点搞笑）。虽然很理解作者想让不同类型的玩家都拥有良好体验的良苦用心，但如果你想让玩家多思考不同解法就应当尽可能减少这类暴力解的数量。<br>掠食的反组引力球就是个很典型的例子：当没有反组引力球又想推开杠杆III需求的货物时会怎么办？哦，原来可以试着用燃气瓶炸开货物或用杠杆II去砸。虽然它也给多了但至少是手上一般不超过10个的消耗品，得精打细算考虑着用。超低蓝条消耗飞行真可以说是一力破万法了，拿到这个能力后搬运箱子搭通道、找斜面、甚至部分区域的视觉跃迁之类解法统统都失去了寻找的意义<br><br>不写了我先去吐一会儿，什么时候想起来再玩吧。			</div>

																Great game. The second steam trailer already does a good job of explaining how the game plays. Don't be fooled by the 'programmer art'; Ctrl Alt Ego is a very well-designed immersive sim featuring an innovative ghost in the machine / possession mechanic. It's not just a short demo of a gimmick either; the game is a fully fleshed out 12+ hour game that only opens up more as it goes and doesn't drop in quality. Highly recommended if you have previously played and enjoyed other immersive sims (System Shock, Deus Ex, Prey, etc.). Ctrl Alt Ego is a real sleeper hit and an outstanding achievement for its two developers.			</div>

																Excellent game, excellent dev.<br><br>Probably one of the best immersive sims I've played in a long time. The puzzles in particular were done very well, with many different 'solutions' which give the player a lot of freedom to play how they would like. <br><br>This may be the inner developer in me talking, but the sound design and overall polish are both top-notch as well.			</div>

																I've been meaning to write a review of this game since I finished the tutorial level and immediately knew I had found something special, but wanted to spend some time engaging with the systems and narrative so I could be sure I was able to really, properly articulate how spectacular Ctrl Alt Ego really is. I think I'm about halfway (or maybe closer to three-fourths) through the game now, and I feel fairly confident in calling this game a genuine landmark in the long-neglected, amorphously defined immersive sim genre. Immersive sims are complex and difficult (which is probably why they're so rare) so I think it also bears pointing out the scale of the developer's accomplishment doing this as an indie dev on their own. The amount of care, effort, and creativity that went into this experience is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ staggering, and the level of polish feels consonant with something a multi-person, well-budgeted studio would put out.<br><br>In Ctrl Alt Ego, you're yourself - an identity that exists discretely, and, presumably, a sui generis manifestation of an actual individual (though questions about the substance and materiality of the player's identity is woven throughout the systems and narrative) in a post-singularity world dominated by a robotics company that manufactures devices disembodied egos such as yourself can - or must - inhabit and control. Mechanically, this manifests itself via a possession system that is reminiscent of the Dishonored skill scaled up and extrapolated to it's logical conclusion, where you float around, jumping from one controllable object/robot/item to another in order to interact with the environment. It sounds pretty straightforward and in many ways it is, and, in the tradition of the great immersive sims of eras past, it can be as complex as your level of engagement; you can elegantly, stealthily, and harmlessly complete challenges or brute-force your way through with your weaponized BUG. <br><br>To that end, Ctrl Alt Ego offers the player a pretty wide range of skills and instruments designed to navigate the fairly large, wonderfully layered levels. While you'll inhabit a number of different robots (there are four that move around and have major utility) you'll mostly spend your time as, appropriately, a BUG. The BUG you occupy can be upgraded via disks, which unlock useful abilities like the shotgun, teleportation, flight, the capacity to remotely move large objects, etc. The disk abilities, in turn, can be upgraded by WORMs, which (in true imsim style) are cleverly scattered around the levels and help incentivize exploration and planning. <br><br>The primary resource is EGO, which is gathered from user-friendly robots and accessories (like the adorable wee motor, little cameras for selfies, and a bunch of other charming little allies). The secondary resource, which is consumed when using abilities unlocked via disks, is juice - shotgun blasts and flight, for example, expend juice. Taking CTRL of puzzle-relevant hosts like doors, hostile robots, cameras, etc costs EGO and creates a delightful, classically game-y dynamic where balancing your juice, EGO, and health inform decisions about puzzle approaches and routes. It's really just an excellent, thoughtfully fleshed out mechanic that makes engaging with the environment both critical and rewarding.<br><br>A mysterious narrator guides you via terminals, and the dialogue associated with those terminals is clever, useful, and has a surprisingly well-manifested voiceover. Prompted by tips from the good Doctor Everyman, the player-as-a-disembodied-ego needs to take CTRL of their environment and unravel the mysterious circumstances aboard the beautifully rendered retro-aesthetic space station where the game is set. I'd like to specifically recognize the clever writing and worldbuilding - Ctrl Alt Ego manages to strike a fine narrative balance between humorous and sinister implications that left me hungry for more exposition and delighted whenever I found it. <br><br>I'd just like to articulate an example of a puzzle that I thought stumped me. I had to open a special door that I couldn't possess. I had scoured all of the adjacent rooms for clues and come up empty. I knew where I had to go and why, but couldn't quite figure out what the solution was. After trying a bunch of things - possessing every camera, maneuvering a little PUP robot (which barks!) to just the right spot, swapping through my various powers, etc, with no success. Finally, in a fit of pique, I picked up an explosive barrel and chucked it right at the offending door - and the blast revealed a special lock that had been stacked underneath some crates I couldn't move manually. Ctrl Alt Ego is essentially a series of "voila!" moments like that and it makes for immensely satisfying moment-to-moment gameplay. <br><br>I could go on and on - the cleverness of the descriptions associated with various hosts, the spectacularly free-form puzzles and sense of accomplishment associated with progression, the on-the-nose-but-somehow-not-derivative retrofuturistic style, the clean and legible graphics, etc, but I'll close with this: Ctrl Alt Ego is an exemplar of the imsim genre. It's characterized by the sort of accelerating complexity of puzzles matched by the player's capacity to engage with them, the necessity of careful observation and interaction with the game world, and substantial, genuinely creative exposition and worldbuilding that makes these games so distinct. It hits the perfect medium between contemporary tutorializing, with all it's overexplaining and unnecessary waypoints, and old-school inscrutability. The UI is slick and intuitive, though not particularly fancy. <br><br>It has a few, barely perceptible rough edges - I've only had to load a save due to a glitch once, and the only real persistent issue is it can sometimes be hard to select the right host in EGO mode (but there are filters that facilitate that). There are tons of difficulty options, both direct (easy-hard selection) and indirect (tool-tips, waypoints, etc can be toggled), the former of which has a major effect on resource accessibility and the likelihood a player who isn't good at puzzles (like me) will be frustrated. I'd also like to give a shout-out to the dev for being so responsive to feedback - the wobbly robots caused some motion sickness for other players and they immediately added a stabilization option that removes it, which I actually found helpful myself from time to time. <br><br>In summary, this game is a rare, singular work of artistic vision that understands the importance of both narrative and mechanical substance. It feels like something a dedicated team with a unique vision spent years building. I don't usually bother writing reviews, but this game deserves it. Buy it at full price. Buy it twice! If you like Deus Ex, Dishonored, and thoughtful science fiction that asks genuine questions about selfhood, identity, and time, you'll find this game is a lot more than the sum of it's parts. 10/10.			</div>

																Only played a few hours so far, but having a ton of fun. Despite being a very modern and physics-driven immersive sim, this feels like a throwback to 80s British microcomputer adventures like Cholo and Paradroid, where the future was immensely crappy and robots were big awkward plastic boxes on treads.<br><br>It's a new game with an old soul, and I can't wait to play more.			</div>

																This game is criminally underrated and deserves much more attention from the community. I don't write reviews or really gush over games but this one is an exception. EASILY my favorite gaming experience in the last several years. Gives me the same feelings I had playing Fallout NV or Skyrim for the first time back when I was only 14. I love it			</div>

																If Gameplay is king, this game is absolute royalty. Gets the highest recommendation. But the caveats... wow, there are caveats... This is an ugly game. Really ugly. Not endearing old style weird/ugly. Not quake ugly, not anatomy ugly, not cruely squad ugly... just... visually boring. I can imagine this gameplay, even the exact same game with a soma coat of paint, or even a ghost possession coat of paint on a weird terror / dungeon vibe... Also the story... It teases something interesting but never gets there... But if you can get over it, (as I did) you are in for a treat.			</div>

																このゲームは高品質なイマーシブシム(没入シミュレーション)FPSである。<br>イマーシブシムってなんだよという人が多いと思うため解説すると、ストーリーベースのゲームで一つの問題点に対して固まった解法が用意されておらず、好きな方法で進めてもよいという設計のゲーム全般を指す模様。<br>比較的最近のゲームでわかりやすく言うならPreyやDishonored、Hitmanなど。Gloomwoodなんかもこれに当たる。<br>なのにSteamで没入シミュレーションのタグを調べると〇〇シミュレータやスポーツゲーが死ぬほど引っ掛かる。つまり誰も理解していないのである。悲しいね<br>全体的なボリュームとしてはじっくり探索して16時間のため、サクサク進めれば12時間程度か。<br><br><div class="bb_h1">ざっくりとしたゲームシステム紹介</div>自分も自分以外も全員ロボのFPS。<br>プレイヤーはロボやインターフェースのCtrlシステムをハッキングすることで乗っ取り、乗り移って進んでいくことになる。<br>基本的にロボットやインターフェース内に入って行動していくことになるのだが、プレイヤー本体はあくまで「エゴ(自我)そのもの」であるため、動かしていたロボットが消し飛んだとしてもそのまま他のロボを乗っ取ればいいだけであり、それを利用して進む場面もある。<br>イマーシブシムだけあって進行に対する解法が多く、ステルスしてもいいし全部破壊して安全に進んでもいいし全部ハックして制御下においてもいいし抜け道を通ってギミック全無視してもいい。<br>サポートしてくれるDr.エブリマンさんのサポートも優しいため、指示通りに動いてもするすると進める。<br><br><div class="bb_h1">主人公の強化要素</div>プレイヤーが基本的に操作する「Bug」ユニットはアップグレード.exeの入ったフロッピーディスクやアップグレードワーム(本当に虫)によりプログラムの習得・強化を行うことが出来、プログラムはエーテルエネルギーを消費して使うことが出来る。<br>エーテルエネルギーはそこらに落ちているオイルのほか、ジュースを飲むことでも回復が可能。<span class="bb_strike">エーテルジュースマズそう</span><br>プログラムはエーテルエネルギーを圧縮してブチ撒けるショットガン、物質を動かすシフト、物質を反物質に変換するフォルトなど大量に用意されており、探索・攻略を助ける。<br>プログラムは取得順が特に決められておらず、持っているアップグレード.exe1枚につき好きなプログラムを覚えることが可能。<br>しかし実はほとんどのプログラムは無くても攻略が出来るようになっており、何なら「ジャンプ」のモジュールすら任意取得である。<br>最初の一個目のプログラム以外一切取らずにクリアの実績などもある。<br><br><div class="bb_h1">妙にリアルな挙動</div>ロボはホバー移動やキャタピラ移動、ローラー4点移動など移動手段やカメラ位置が異なり、<br>よりによって挙動がクソ真面目に適用されるため、ホバーの場合はすごい傾くし滑る。<br>本体が回転するとカメラもすごい回る。<br>監視カメラは当然FOVが跳ね上がって魚眼レンズになる。<br>多分酔う人はものすごく酔う。<br><br><div class="bb_h1">難易度</div>FPS的な難易度は高くなく、無限復活かつ現在状況はそのまま残るため、下手でもそのうちクリア可能。<br>どちらかというと宇宙ステーションの探索・攻略に重きを置いている感じ。<br><br><div class="bb_h1">まとめ</div>レトロフューチャーな見た目でしっかりとSFしていてイマーシブシムをやりたいなら大当たり。<br>日本語訳はなく文章がかなり多いためある程度翻訳機を噛ますか英語が読める人向け。			</div>

																Ctrl Alt Ego has treated me to one of the most open-ended experiences I've ever had among any immersive sim I've played. It's criminal how relatively unknown this game is and I strongly recommend it if you are a fan of the genre.<br><br>I've played and enjoyed the recent Deus Ex games, Dishonored, and Prey (2017) and when I started playing Ctrl Alt Ego, and I was absolutely floored with the amount of different ways I could approach a problem. The sheer amount of solutions to a problem can be credited to the mechanic that sets Ctrl Alt Ego apart from other im-sim's; you can posess and take control of various objects in the environment. You can control a wide array of elements in the environment such as BUG's, PUP's, DAD's, MUM's, trip mines, cameras, doors, elevators, etc. each with their own unique set of functions and limitations. These objects are relatively simple to understand on their own but when you start to use them to play off of one another, you will begin to realize there are nearly limitless ways to approach a problem. This open-ended gameplay lends itself really well to multiple playthroughs. <br><br>I think this game is better geared for instrically motivated players over extrinsically motivated players. The narrative isn't as engaging as the  imm-sim games I mentioned earlier. I think this could be improved with a stronger narrative hook in the beginning portion of the game. If you are reading the computer logs/META pages of certain objects you control in the early levels, you can get the sense something weird happened on the space station and this is really cool but I kind of wish there was more beyond some environmental hints.<br><br><br>I also want to give credit to MindThunk for being a really active developer. I purchased the game months after it was launched and it was still getting bug fixes, new features, and just a few days ago a new content update with the sandbox mode. I also think it's very nice how active he is on various forums answering any questions players have or trying to learn more about technical issues they encounter.			</div>

																WOW I am fully blown away. I'm not HUGE into immersive sims but i've played quite a few of the gems. This is BY FAR the best immersive sim that I've ever played. I meant to play for an hour and 3 hours flew by. What a UNIQUE game. I believe ANYONE that tries this game, will have to admit there is no other game like this. The freedom is insane. And there are few games that ooze personality like this one. THIS IS A GEM. You WILL NOT regret buying. I absolutely hate puzzles. CAN'T STAND THEM. But the freedom of this game makes every puzzle completely mind blowing and keeps the game entertaining. And the action is a blast and the upgrades are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ awesome. I can't be more shocked at how good this game is. I had done some research and this game was made by 2 guys, and (if i recall) one of them left while the last guy finished it. This game is a masterpiece and truly deserves mainstream success and I hope to see more by MindThunk. A good dev name for a game that requires thinking and experimenting. I am fully blown away at how much of a masterpiece this game is. TRULY a gem. I own a TON of games (especially on Steam) and I have never played a game like this before.			</div>

																Truly awesome immersive sim. A bit like an Arkane style im-sim in that it gives the player a list of really unique superpowers and asks them to use them in an internally consistent world. The biggest break from Arkane’s formula is that CTRL ALT EGO leans more towards puzzle solving than action, although plenty of the latter is possible. I have some criticisms, but they are all nitpicks that aren’t worth bringing up in a review. <br><br>Steam Deck users: this game works perfectly out of the box without even needing to find a community control scheme. The battery drains a little faster than in other similar games, but at least a couple hours are possible on a full charge.			</div>

																I've played a good number of immersive sims and this stands comfortably among the best of them. The visuals are simple but consistent and fit the setting well, and that's about the only vague complaint I have. There's a good amount of variety as well, and some of the environments in the back half of the game get very big and twisty. Generally speaking, the game feels very <i>smooth</i> to play; the little interactions and UX elements feel refined and honed to keep the player moving.<br>I also ended up liking the story, script, humor, music, and even the vast majority of the vocal performance. It stayed charming and intriguing the whole way through.<br>Definitely check out the demo. If you like the demo, I bet you will like the whole game.			</div>

																I first heard about Ctrl Alt Ego on a Reddit post in mid-2022 the week the game launched. It seemed like an interesting game and I’m a huge immersive sim fan, so I bought it out of principle to support the indie developer for making such a niche and very difficult to develop style of game. Fast forward a few months, and I started hearing rumblings in the immersive sim community about how great the game was. This week, I finally sat down to play it and I was extremely impressed.<br><br>In Ctrl Alt Ego, you play as a disembodied consciousness that is able to jump between various electronic objects, like robots, cameras, etc., and possess them. You mostly spend your time in a robot known as Bug 22, who serves as your primary vessel and is the bot you will acquire upgrades for throughout the game. Upgrades include a shotgun, a vacuum, the ability to download items and spawn them in front of you, and much more. When your vessel is destroyed, you just choose something else to jump to. Bug 22 can also be reprinted as much as you need when it is destroyed, so there isn’t a true fail state in the game. Like any good immersive sim, there are a wide variety of playstyles and ways to progress, and a bit of creative thinking potentially leads to some “I can’t believe that worked” moments. You can be stealthy or run and gun. You can hack everything and turn bots against each other or conserve your Ego resource and find another way through environmental manipulation or something else. Don’t have a tool needed for one solution? You could most likely use another to make another way forward. The game combines the level design of imsims like Prey and System Shock with the tool heavy experimentation of Thief while putting a strong emphasis on the puzzle solving element of the genre. I HATE most puzzles in games but the key difference here is that the open nature of Ctrl Alt Ego allowed me to think of my own solutions instead of frantically search for THE solution. Throw in a refreshing, somewhat lighter-hearted tone and aesthetic (at least on the surface) and you have one of the most unique immersive sims I’ve ever played.<br><br>I also want to touch on the HUD options. The game allows for optional hints and objective markers that can be turned on and off at your leisure. This is fantastic and it’s something we need to see in more games. I hate quest marker discourse but my take is that there is nothing wrong with objective markers themselves (some people need them due to disabilities or just a horrid sense of direction), but having them in games can make level design lazier since there isn’t a need for the player to learn layouts by analyzing the environment around them, so you end up with locations that feel very “video gamey” and don’t make much practical sense. Therefore, I am of the opinion that games should be designed without markers in mind, but include them as an option for those who want them. That is exactly what this game does. I played the majority of the game with them off, but there were a few moments where I was stumped as to the location of the next objective, so I went into the options menu and briefly turned them on to see where I needed to go, then turned them off again. This option enabled me to have an immersive experience where I searched the environment extensively with an out in case I searched everywhere and was hardstuck. There are going to be moments in games where a developer screws up and doesn’t include any easily decipherable hints as to where to go for a specific objective or even messes up the directions given to you (looking at you, Morrowind). This addition ensures that the player will be able to progress no matter what should worst come to worst. It’s especially great these are here since the game is so niche that there aren’t any written walkthroughs for it that I have seen.<br><br>As great as the game is, it has a few problems. It’s a Unity game and comes with very wonky Unity physics that make navigation with some of the bots in some areas very difficult. Notably, using the PUP on some surfaces can make it turn in ways it shouldn’t and you could potentially fall off an elevated location. Furthermore, moving MUMs between surfaces is sometimes near impossible and creates an issue where they can’t move forward when they should be able to. The Unity engine also causes some severe performance dips later in the game, particularly in areas that have a lot of enemies or have mirrors. The combat in the game is very basic and feels extremely clunky, partially because of the robotic nature of the characters but still. There is also an insane difficulty spike during a later part of the game where there is an area with around 20 roving enemy bots that will swarm you if you aren’t careful. They can fly too, so they can seemingly come out of nowhere when your back is turned and kill you in seconds. Lastly, and I could be wrong about this, but I suspect that this game has a few instances where soft locks are possible. During the aforementioned difficulty spike, there was a point where two enemy bots were literally spawn camping me as they stood next to the only bot printer I had available at that time, resulting in one of the few instances of me reloading a save. I also think I found a problem with the last puzzle of the game where I was nearly locked out of completing it because a controllable enemy wandered to me past a gate that wouldn’t open after it shut behind the enemy. I was at an absolute loss as to how I could possibly figure it out (this was getting the DEV disk for those of you who played). Thankfully, I used a very specific upgrade in a very non-conventional manner to complete the puzzle and finish the game. However, this solution was so weird that I feel like there either had to be another way or I was locked out of the normal solutions.<br><br>Being an immersive sim fan isn’t always easy. Due to how hard they are to design and the fact that most of them don’t sell well, Triple A immersive sims aren’t very common. These days, most big-budget imsims are either made by Arkane (such as Prey, Dishonored, and Deathloop), or they’re totally cursed and stuck in development hell (like Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2, System Shock 3, or whatever was supposed to come after Deus Ex: Mankind Divided). Thankfully, the indie scene is picking up the slack and delivering great experiences like the one I’m reviewing here. Ctrl Alt Ego was made by literally two people and is an excellent game that shows the future of this genre is bright, regardless of what happens in the Triple A space.<br><br>8.5/10			</div>

																This title is an essential entry into the "Immersive Sim" genre (Prey + Mooncrash, System Shock, Deus Ex, Dishonored, Thief). <b>There's a generously long demo which gives a far better impression than any review will.</b><br><br>As for other games in the genre, there is a lot of player freedom in how to tackle each obstacle. Where this game distinguishes itself is its core mechanic: the player is disembodied and has the ability to hijack and control most other robots for a small resource cost. This means that enemies aren't just obstacles, but tools that can be used to solve the level.<br><br>This mechanic alone makes the game worth checking out but on top of it there's also<br><ul class="bb_ul">  <li>Novel player abilities - standout ability was Fault that allows for turning any physics object into a bomb then infecting other nearby objects with the bomb state for huge chain reactions<br>  </li><li>Levels that get larger  and more non-linear as the game progresses<br>  </li><li>Great enemy design - There's only a small handful of enemy types but each type has distinct behaviour and the level design + player options prevents this from getting stale</li></ul><br>In short, 10/10, just try the demo.<br><br>Other notes:<br><ul class="bb_ul">  <li>Performance was decent, just above recommended specs and kept the game locked to 60 fps as 120 wasn't attainable, some frame drops when causing massive chain reactions with explosives)<br>  </li><li> There's no inventory management</li></ul>			</div>

																I'm biased as hell, because I've translated the game, but I've became a fan long before working on it.<br><br>This is the one and only immersive sim that is close to Deus Ex 2000 in freedom, expressiveness and design. At every moment you're the most powerful being in the room and also you're in the worst position possible and everyone wants you dead. <br><br>It is also one of the best puzzle games out there. The story is interesting, deep and funny at the same time. Level design is superb, sound is crunchy and the graphics are... stylish...<br><br>There's lots and lots of accessibility options so if something's bugging you, you can change it!<br>There's also a pack of hard missions for true immersive sim'ers..? And also, there's a sanbox mode where you can randomly generate, share and play infinite amounts of new levels!<br><br>True modern classic and my favourite game alongside DE!			</div>

																<div class="bb_h3">《Ctrl Alt Ego》=《Prey》+《Watch Dogs》+《Ghost Trick》+《程序员笑话集》</div>Prey：简直不像小独立团队能做出来的高度凝练的关卡地图结构和多途径完成目标的能力系统，每关都可以无击杀无警觉零资源开的超灵活底层系统。<br>Watch Dogs：骇入一切的能力，略带潜行的玩法，资源控制的规划，以及以掌握视野和路线规划为核心的破关思路。<br>Ghost Trick：“万物皆我”的操控逻辑与“我为何物”的哲学思考，需要理解并利用被控制物件特性的操作模式，带有很强解谜性质的关卡推进模式。同时与《幽灵诡计》不同，物件特性逻辑更加系统完备化，避免了对电波的解谜思考。<br>程序员笑话集：从最初的机制教学导入到后面的分支收集lore，甚至是最基础的系统名称，到处都充斥着诙谐幽默的程序员段子，虽然目前没有中文，且部分谐音和双关梗应该很难翻译成中文，但光是就我能看懂的部分来说可以算是有相当高级的幽默感了，时刻能让我会心一笑。<br><br>当然，CAE可不止只有从前辈中学习的优点。CAE是我玩过的唯一“不过度强调减员”的沉浸式模拟游戏，虽然别的游戏也有“想怎么玩就这么玩，杀敌击晕潜行绕过或更有创造力的方式都能通关”的口号，但最终的结果往往是如果不用道德值、混乱度、评分系统等外部手段加以限制，击杀击晕或者说减员永远是最直观的选项，玩家直觉上并不会把它和其他手段摆在同等地位。而CAE优秀的底层系统设计和叙事结构逻辑能让你真正感受到，游戏里并没有真正的敌人甚至没有真正的死亡，所有东西都是关卡的一部分，所谓的敌人威胁不过是攻克关卡这栋大厦中的一块砖，也许这块砖有砸到自己的风险，但粉碎它只是手段中的一种，合理规避甚至利用它也可以让这些砖块为自己铺出一条前进的道路。<br>CAE真可谓是青出于蓝而胜于蓝，学习百家之所长而做出了自己的风采。虽然由于小团队规模制作导致中后期的新内容新机制偏少，破关手法可能会有一定的定势和通解导致略带一定重复度，但是把自己的想法实现到如此高的完成度，而且甚至没有以Early Access形式而是推出完demo以后直接出了正式版，其强大的项目管理能力实在令人汗颜（《Gloomwood》、《Fortune's Run》、《Fallen Aces》你们说是吧……），可谓是沉浸式模拟在独立游戏领域的一大里程碑了。			</div>

																尽管在商业上可能表现不佳，但并不妨碍本作成为Immersive Sim的史上佳作之一。<br><br>什么叫酒香也怕巷子深啊，这就是活脱脱的例子。要不是油管up Charlatan Wonder我根本不会知道有这么个游戏，然后我一点进商店页面就差点被画质给劝退了：这啥啊？<br><br>不过这几年科幻Immersive Sim要么还处于种小麦的阶段，要么直接难产，实在游戏荒的我还是决定试试本作。但是一上手，我就被本作极高的完成度震惊了，这真是俩人（其中一个还中途跑路了）做出来的游戏？<br><br>解谜和关卡推进、剧情发展完美而自然地融合在一起，毫无割裂感。制作人没有限制玩家以任何方式推进关卡，游戏也没有道德值一类的指标对玩家进行“道德评判”，无论你是喜欢杀光眼前一切敌人的FPS玩家还是喜欢追求潜行和0杀的和平主义者都能找到适合自己的风格，甚至即便玩家不是剧情党，不看文档也能一样享受游戏。复杂（但不会导致迷路，因为游戏有相当友好的路牌指示）而有新意的关卡设计在为多种过关方式提供底层支撑的同时能让玩家直到通关都会不断产生探索的新鲜感。“场景重复度高”“关卡设计单一”这样的评价绝对和本作无缘。引导恰到好处，既不会让玩家产生“我是谁我要干啥”的想法，也不会让玩家产生“你在教我做事？”的恼火。在Immersive Sim的设计哲学上，这款游戏无疑是做得相当好的。<br><br>然后是一点私货，这个游戏真的有好多码农看了会心一笑的梗哈哈哈，作者一看就是资深码农了，比如Merging Station那个版本管理，日常被git整到头疼的我很难不共情~<br><br>这个游戏除了画面外似乎很难找到什么令人恼火的短板，但奇怪的是在国外都不怎么火，国内由于本地化问题就更别说了。可能是Immersive Sim本身就小众，加上steam商店里挂的截图画质实在有点劝退，再加上制作人没钱搞宣发导致了这样的结果。这样的精品独立游戏被埋没还是很可惜的，好评支持一下吧。<br><br>p.s.顺便给自己写的这个游戏的全收集攻略打个广告：<br><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2894000460" class="dynamiclink_box modalContentLink webguide_item ugc" data-modal-content-sizetofit="false" data-appid="1571940" data-publishedfileid="2894000460">

																Yarış oyunlarının bende yeri çok ayrıdır. Arabalara, yarışlara ilgim çok küçük yaşta daha yürümeyi bile öğrenmeden başladı. Oyuncak arabalar, sadece resimlerine baktığım araba dergileri derken kendimi çok küçük yaşta bir bilgisayarın başında Need for Speed oynarken buluverdim. Yıllar boyunca dijital dünyada direksiyon salladım, yıllarca yarıştım birinci geldim ki zaten bir yarış oyununu kazanmanın yoluda buydu, birinci gelmek. Ancak yıllar sonra Driver San Francisco isimli bir yarış oyunu ile karşılaştım. Bu Driver serisi ile ilk karşılaşmam değildi ve aşağı yukarı ne ile karşılaşacağımıda biliyordum. Bu sefer San Francisco şehrinde gerçek araba markalarıyla bir araba yarışı oynayacaktım, ne güzel. Oyuna başladım, ilk görevi bitirdim ve oyun bana daha önce hiç görmediğim bir mekanik tanıttı "Shift" mekaniği.<br><br>Bu mekanik ne diyenler için anlatayım. Shift mekaniği oyuncuyu sürücü koltuğundan alıp oyun alanına kuş bakışı bir kamera ile baktırıp oyuncunun imleç ile üzerine geldiği arabanın kontrolünü oyuncuya veren diğer bir değişle oyun alanındaki her arabayı kontrol edebilmemizi sağlayan bir mekanik. Yıllarca dijital dünyada direksiyon salladım ve bunun sonucunda tek bir şey öğrenmiştim o da yarışı kazanmak için birinci gelmemiz gerektiğiydi ancak Driver San Francisco bu Shift mekaniği ile kendi arabamızı 1 metre bile sürmeden yarışı kazanabilme imkanı sunuyordu. Yarışta arabamızdan Shift ile çıkıp kamyona geçip diğer yarışçıların arabalarını parçalayabilir, polis arabası alıp diğer yarışçılara çarpıp peşlerine polisi takabilir ya da yarış dışında polise çarptıysak ve uğraşmak istemiyorsak başka bir arabaya geçip oyunumuza rahatça devam edebilirdik yani yıllarca yarış oyunu oynamış birinin bile ilk kez bir yarış oyunu oynuyormuşçasına keyif almasını sağladı. Oyun Shift mekaniğinin gücünün farkında olup her bir anında onu daha eğlenceli daha etkili kullanmayı amaçladığı için çok eğlenceli ve özgün bir yarış oyunu olmuştu.Bu mekaniğin robot hacklemek veya bir süreliğine başka bir bedenin kotrolünü elimize almak gibi türevleri olsada oyunun bütününü bu mekanik üzerine kuran başka bir oyun çıkmamıştı.<br><br>İşte tamda burada Ctrl Alt Ego devreye giriyor. Sadece araba sürebildiğimiz bir oyunda bile oynanışı bu kadar çeşitlendiren bu mekanik bir Immersive Sim'de yani tamamiyle oyuncunun bir sorunu çözmesi üzerine kurulu bir oyunda nasıl mı olmuş? Tek kelime ile HARİKA. Yeterli Ego puanınız olduğu sürece oyun alanındaki her şeyin (düşman, kamera, tablet...) kontrolünü elimize alabiliyoruz. Yeri gelir karşındaki her şeyi eritip başka bir yerde spawn edebilen bir düşmanın kontrolünü, yeri gelir daracık yerlere girebilen bir robotun kontrolünü elimize alabilmek yetmezmiş gibi bir çokta karakter geliştirmeside bu mekanikle birleşince problem çözmek acayip eğlenceli olmuş. <br><br>Son dönemlerde tekrardan popülerleşen Immersive Sim türünün bir sorunu şu ki sadece eskiden çıkmış Immersive Sim oyunlarını tekrardan yapıyormuş gibi hissettirmesi. Türün şu "kutuları üst üste koyup bölümü geçme" olayı yeni birçok Immersive Sim'i bir lanet gibi sarmış türe yenilik katmaktansa, gücü oyuncuya vermektense sadece bir oyuncunun çözebileceği tarzda çözümleri problemin çözümü yapmak sanan birtakım oyunlar yüzünden tür son zamanlarda her ne kadar geri dönüş yapmış olsada eskisi gibi ilgi çekici değillerdi. Üzgünüm Gloomwood evet çok güzel Souls vari bölüm tasarımların var, evet save scummingi engellemek için çokta güzel bir yöntem bulmuşsun ve evet bugün artık antika sayılan Thief, Deus Ex gibi oyunların yerine her zaman seni önereceğim ama bana seni oynamam için "yeni" bir sebep vermiyorsun. Ama Ctrl Alt Ego ise türde yeni hissettiren bu mekaniği ile çokta fazla oyuncağa sahip olması ve tabii ki de oyununda bunları anlayıp mantıklı cevaplar vermesi sayesinde son zamanlarda oynamaktan en keyif aldığım Immersive Sim olmayı başarmıştır. 2 kişilik ufak ekibi buradan tebrik ediyorum. Zaten bir şekilde bu incelemeyi okuyorsanız Immersive Sim türünü duymuşsunuz demektir tamda bu sebeple bu incelemeyi okuyan herkese oyunu öneriyorum.			</div>

																They finally did it, an immersive sim where every single path you can take feels bad. combat is dull, stealth is woeful, and collecting the most important resource takes three times as long as it should. all while you're getting a headache from the visuals. even basic movement feels like you're trundling about on wheels three times smaller than what your robot actually has.			</div>

																This is a truly brilliant game. Really original and creative. I think it did extremely well on the following points:<br><br>- Well-functioning 3D environment with realistic graphics.<br>- Simulated danger and "combat" which does not involve the grim and depressing elements of a typical FPS. There is a gun option available (among many others) but you don't have to use it.<br>- Well executed humor<br>- Good voice acting<br>- Enjoyable plot line<br>- Good amount of playtime<br>- Great physics-based game mechanics<br>- Extraordinary flexibility in problem solving, ie difficult strategic challenges with multiple unique solutions.<br><br>The only negative, if you can call it that, is that the difficulty level (for me) rose sharply later in the game. I was really daunted at one point, but did get things sorted out after discussion with the devs. Note to devs: Don't change a thing!			</div>

																This is a hidden gem that unfortunately may not get the exposure it deserves.  It is very very well done.<br><br>* Unique and fun gameplay mechanics, check.<br>* Interesting, well written, and well voice acted story, check.<br>* Open ended immersive gameplay systems that let you complete your goals in a variety of ways, with a variety of tools, check.<br>* Great save system with lot's of opportunity to mess around with fairly little punishment but still manages to give you the motivation to not die, check.<br>* Overall the game design is top notch.<br>* Decent graphics, check.<br>* Fair price, check.<br><br>Considering the depth and complexity of the systems that the game has in it I am also happy to report that I have ran into very very few bugs, and no game breaking bugs.  I had one crash but it was after leaving my computer on the pause screen for about 40 minutes while eating dinner.  Game seems very stable overall when playing.<br><br>There is so much to love about this game, and I can't recommend it enough to people who like immersive sims like Prey, Dishonored, etc.  For the price this a must play.  We just don't get enough games like this and I'm very happy to have found this game.			</div>

																Just a quick early review to say that this is a fun puzzler.  My method here is to do about an hour or two and then do a new game immediately.  It takes a little bit of time  to absorb all the mechanics of the game and a replay just really makes things come into focus.  The developer is on hand if you run into a problem but I have had no bugs or glitches and everything seems to be running smoothly.<br><br><br>Edit:  Yes, buy a copy for yourself and a friend.  I'm over 50 hours in now and still not quite sure how this is going to end.  What a great game with unlimited saves and reloads.  Lots of achievements to uncover and a few challenging ones thrown in too.  There's a lot to understand at first glance but that quickly fades as you gain more experience.  Excellent environments to explore and with a very generous difficulty scale you'll have no problem getting around.  Great voice acting to keep you amused but not overly chatty or distracting.  A good HUD with tabs to keep you informed and a full option menu to customize your gameplay.<br><br>A real gem, one of my best buys for the year.			</div>

																Ctrl Alt Ego is a slightly weird and wonderful indie game that's well worth the asking price IMHO. There are a ton of different ways to approach the various puzzles/tasks in the game (or, in some cases, skip them entirely), and MindThunk's clearly put a ton of care into making the game. I've beaten it once already going for stealth the first time around, and now I'm going back through on a lower difficulty to try a more combat-oriented approach and get more of the achievements. Highly recommended, and I really hope the dev decides to make a sequel or some DLC at some point in the future :)			</div>

																This isn't really an imsim, more like a first-person puzzle game. There's no sense of what the place you're exploring is meant to be other than "space station," the world just feels like a series of levels put together to challenge the player. There's no sense of it being a real space where things serve a purpose, so it fails at the "immersive" aspect.			</div>

																Narratively it makes sense that transferring your consciousness between objects is disorienting and nauseating. Causing the player to be disoriented and nauseated every time you do so, which is often, is a bold artistic choice. Not many are willing to intentionally harm their audience as part of the piece. This is partly because most audiences do not enjoy being harmed. If you are strong of will, and stomach, give this game a look. You'll find me lying in a dark room until I stop feeling sick.			</div>

																Just wanted to leave a good review, It's been great so far in my playthrough. Hopefully will update this into a full review after I finish it. The world needs more developers like you, godspeed.<br><br>Edit: Finished the game, while there are some performance issues near the end of the game (only the last chapter, other than that it was fine). This game was great. I think I understood the story pretty well too but if you don't care about lore or anything you don't have to to enjoy the game.<br> <br> Ctrl Alt Ego is a phenomenal game that made me (an immersive sim hater) into an fan. My favourite part of the game is that you don't have to play any specific style compared to other immersive sims where if you do a certain thing you get bad results. The game is completely free and it shines in the last chapter where it's completely open.<br> <br> I feel nostalgic already about the first few levels of the game and that should be saying something. Game is definitely worth the value, I'd highly recommend it to anyone that's into video games.			</div>

																quite possibly the most creative solo dev indie game i have ever played<br>the worldbuilding and lore is interesting, the dialogue is funny, the gameplay is phenomenal, it is a true labour of love. you can really tell that 7 years of work went into this game, it's shockingly polished. my only gripe i have in my 5-ish hours of playing is that there's a very prominent weightlessness to the weapons (which really is more of a personal taste type of thing) and the amount of freedom you truly have to solve these levels is unravelled somewhat slowly, the way you can experiment with the mechanics aren't showcased well enough in the prologue but, other than that, it is probably my indie game of the year<br>i will definitely be looking out for more games from mindthunk and also hopefully an expansion of whatever we got in this game, even though i probably still have another couple of hours to go till i actually finish the game  💀			</div>

																Easily my game of the year. In fact it should have been game of the year when it came out. This is THE perfect immersive sim and should be credited as such. To say this was made by two developers is astonishing, Everything fits and works perfectly. The writing, music, game play and setting mould perfectly into a very British, comedic, 80's sci-fi bonanza. The fun and creativity they poured into this game oozes out in every facet of its being. These two absolutely smashed it out of the park. If you liked Prey 2017 then you will absolutely adore this title. A very well deserved 9.5 out of 10. Would be higher were it not for some frame rate issues in the last levels.			</div>

																Крутий імерсивний симулятор з акцентом на "симулятор".<br>Дуже круті системи, широкий вибір можливостей і все це у повністю фізичному оточенні. <br>Візуальний стиль може бути на любителя, але до нього швидко звикаєш.			</div>

																A top tier Immersive Simulated Experience. If you're even aware of this genre then you're likely to find a decent bit of enjoyment in this game. It takes the light puzzle element present in many imsims and brings it to the forefront of the experience, to the point where it's more dominant than the usual first person shooter framing, you don't even need to get a gun. This makes for a really unique experience, especially thanks to just how open for creativity the game is clearly built.<br><br>There are so many great mechanics on display here that i don't know where to start and where would i even end with them. Not only is there an already solid foundation of abilities your bug is able to do, which range from a typical shotgun to being able to spawn most objects and enemies in the game, but there is also the ability to take control of almost any significant enemy or object that might be standing in your way (this is also why that latter ability is actually pretty significant). This opens up so many options. You may use them as scouts, as safer passages into the next area, to smuggle things into the enemy circles or to just attack the enemies outright while keeping your bug safe and the list goes on... I will not mention everything not only because it would go on for way too long but also because the fun part is figuring out how to best use all these mechanics to get past some often pretty tough challenges. Creativity can often really pay off! There have been a fair few moments where after figuring out a fun solution to a problem i had been stuck on for a while i laughed, thinking "I can't believe that actually worked!" <br><br>Ctrl alt ego has a particular retro futuristic aesthetic of huge and bulky machines in a world set in the far far future that is fairly distinct, in a way it's interesting to see a game focus on an aesthetic from the past that is not so flashy. Its visuals may not be the strongest aspect, but i don't think they can really be called a flaw. Plus i do actually really like all the robot designs. The game also has quite a bit of humor in it and it generally delivers with some fun writing while in possesion of hosts. One of my favorites of these is the song that plays while in possesion of a DOR (which alone makes me wish for some kind of ost release). The story follows in similar footsteps, with a bunch of absurd humor and while it is at times confusing and takes a while to get going i still found it interesting and very fitting for the game. All this combined with quirks like the many cat pictures or worms as upgrades(ready to worm is a great phrase), the game does have a charm to it. <br><br>Overall, Ctrl Alt Ego really is a wonderful game. It stands toe to toe with many acclaimed games in the genre and i think it even surpasses many of them in its gameplay. I can't say there's a whole lot i dislike about it either, other than some pretty minor nitpicks. I'm likely going to be replaying it and messing around more with some of its mechanics i havent gotten to use as much and trying some of its harder challenges.			</div>

																An Imm-Sim so good, when I beat it, I immediately played it again on a higher difficulty. Took me 15 hours for my first playthrough, though I took an extended time after clearing a level to find as many secrets as I could've. Second time around, just under 8 hours.<br><br><br>On top of that, when I ran into a gamebreaking bug, the developer themself got into contact and had the issue resolved within two hours of my initial report. Lovely work.<br>			</div>

																Ctrl Alt Ego is a joy of a game I did not expect.<br><br>I played the classic Looking Glass (Ultima Underworld, System Shock, Thief) and Arkane (Arx Fatalis, Dark Messiah, Dishonored, Prey) games as they were released, and I'm always looking for games whose developers show a similar love for smart and enjoyable worldbuilding. Those don't come along every day, so to discover a new game that not only "gets" the immersive sim vibe but manages to add its own fresh take on the genre is an absolute delight.<br><br>Ctrl Alt Ego is the rare game that coherently integrates its mechanics of play with its setting and storytelling with its world-dynamics, each deepening the others with unexpected but perfectly sensible resonances. As you travel through the world, swapping one robot body for another, the question "What am I?" is both part of the the game story and a question to the player, giving real depth to the gameplay fun. Without ever lecturing -- there's some bit of wicked British humor tucked away everywhere -- after briefly pondering the nature of individual consciousness it's easy to realize one moment that you're intently focused on figuring out one of the game's many clever puzzles, then the next moment madly steering your current robotic host around a corner to hide from an alerted antagonist and plan your next move.<br><br>This is exactly what a computer game ought to be: smart, distinctive, polished, challenging, funny, thoughtful, and ultimately highly satisfying for someone who enjoys discovering the secrets of a well-designed and fun simulated world. Highly recommended!			</div>

																Начнём с того, что это НЕ плохая игра, пожалуй даже хорошая. Но сложив все её плюсы и минусы я просто не могу с чистым сердцем её рекомендовать. Если было бы можно, тут стояла честная “смешанная” оценка, а так вынужден поставить отрицательную.<br><br>Собственно, минусы:<br>1) Это игра на юнити, В ПЛОХОМ СМЫСЛЕ.<br>Прямо что-то на уровне первой поделки про Слендермена (если помните). Графика - страшная, простенькая, одним словом устаревшая лет на 15.<br>Физика тоже себе на уме. По началу весело от того какая она не предсказуемая, но веселье заканчивается после того, как ваш персонаж отправляется в свободное плавание и благополучно об что-нибудь взрывается пока вы заняты другими делами (было раза 3 как минимум со мной).<br>При этом производительность - никакущая. Я со своей ноутбучной 3070ти сидел в районе 60-90 фпс (настроек графики, кстати, тоже почти нет).<br><br>2)Неравномерная подача сюжета.<br>Первые 7 часов гемплея сюжета нет практически (а это пол игры). И потом уже начинают появляться персонажи, объясняется что происходит и так далее.<br>Устройство мира подробно объясняется аж на самой последней локации. А что происходит в концовке я вообще плохо понимаю.<br><br>3) Здесь есть оригинальная механика ЭГО, которая представляет собой что-то вроде внутриигровой валюты. В первой половине игры его количество строго ограничено, что заставляет напрячь мозги в зависимости от выбранного варианты прохождения. Но вот во вторую часть игры авторы как будто забивают на всю механику и дают просто практически неограниченные запасы это самого ЭГО. Что, естественно, портит всю экономику игры.(Хотя, пожалуй, если вы проходите игру на пацифизме, то количество оправдано, не проверял.)<br><br>4) Тут очень сложно завалить прохождение локации. Смерти ничего не значат, можно печатать персонажа неограниченное количество раз. И даже когда вам кажется, что все пути завалены или недоступны всегда находится ещё один альтернативный. Опять-таки, можно похвалить разработчиков за такую изобретательность. Но с другой стороны это убивает смысл проходить игру каким-то особым образом, прохождение никак не влияет на концовку или сюжет(насколько могу судить). Если и мучатся, то только ради ачивок.<br><br>Теперь про хорошее. Тут очень оригинальные и необычные механики геймплея которые вы нигде больше не встретите и которые стоят внимания. Я бы сказал они тянут всю игру. Именно благодаря им у игры рейтинг 96%.<br><br>......но в качестве первого вхождения в жанр эмерсив сим точно не советую. Лучше поиграйте в ремейк систем шока. Но если на него нет денег(не продают в СНГ), то и это по скидке зайдёт в целом нормально.			</div>

																Самый иммерсивный иммерсив сим из всех иммерсив симов. Космические станции, потайные проходы, сумасшедший искусственный интеллект, стелс, роботы, разнообразные варианты прохождения, интерактивное окружение и, самое главное, котики! Много котиков. Что ещё желать? Отличная игра.			</div>

																This is an excellent immersive sim, which I could not put down until I'd reached the credits. It excels at giving the player enormous freedom, and has a very intriguing story to go along with it. It is lean in its systems where it needs to be; there's no inventory management, there's infinite respawning, etc. But it knows where to be complex, where to let the player creatively problem solve and feel like they are coming up with unique solutions. The game knows what is important, and this value-set is what keeps the game fun and engaging from start to finish. <br><br>I have a few small nitpicks, but they are very small considering I could not put the game down until the credits rolled. For one, the performance suffers in certain areas even though this game is not a looker, which I put down to poor optimization. Sometimes the audio is not mixed well, and you have some sound effects playing out incredibly loud (explosions, gun shots, certain demonic voices) which can be jarring. My final nitpick is that the physics are super wonky, and sometimes lead to undesirable outcomes like things exploding when you don't want them to, being unable to pick up an item that is inches away, trouble getting your character through doorways and vents, etc. <br><br>Overall, an incredibly fun and interesting game from Mindthunk. I might just start a new playthrough now and do things totally differently...			</div>

																Nauseating and frustrating.<br><br>Almost every action requires a warped visual sequence that contribute to a bizarre type of motion sickness. You can also only control either static objects or physics objects, so your vision and movement are subject to forces that feel arbitrary. <br><br>Enemies take the form of turrets with undodgeable, nearly unblockable attacks. Fighting them is a chore and sneaking by them is also a pain without the right build. <br><br>A weird amount of the dialogue is so self-referential it shatters the suspension of disbelief. They actually say *out loud* that the situation has been contrived for you to succeed at one point. <br><br>It's a cool idea that isn't executed horribly, but there are too many consistent issues for it to be a fun time to me.			</div>

																One of the best immersive sims I've ever played.<br>(If you're not familiar with immersive sims, they're games like Deus Ex, System Shock, or Dishonored).<br><br>The gimmick of taking over the bodies of your opponents is both better than I expected, but also not used as much as I expected. It becomes just another tool you can use sometimes, in addition to the usual immersive sim tools such as guns, stealth, and creative crate stacking. <br><br>The main story has a surprisingly long playtime for such a small team, and the level design is a lot (in a good way). Also, lots of neat real time lighting effects.<br><br>I didn't like the ending much. Although, it did remind me of the ending of my 2nd favorite Terry Gilliam movie. So it can't be all bad.			</div>

																This is such a weird and immersive experience.  It takes a little getting used to, but the logic of this strange world is extremely enjoyable once you get going.  <br><br>I was really surprised at how dynamic the game is in terms of how you approach problems.  It really gives the player a lot of agency and flexibility.  I am still not quite sure WHAT I am doing in his game, but it is definitely fun!			</div>

																I can not praise this game enough. It is an immersive sim like deus ex, prey or thief. It gives you a level with an objective, how you solve it is entirely up to you. You can sneak to the objective, shoot your way through or cause mayhem by stacking boxes, explosive barrels and more. Also, the achievements are all pictures of (the developers?) cats.			</div>

																An amazing entry to the Immersive Sim genre that we need more of. Equal parts sneak or shoot, you play how you want to, and figure out the puzzles that the world presents you. You are able to explore in a novel way, but the whole package is better than the description of the parts could offer. Unraveling the world and the story is fantastic and the humor and little touches in each HOST add so much to the world.<br><br>Do try the demo to see if it strikes your fancy and pick it up to support a clearly passionate small dev team who have pored their heart and soul into something we don't have enough of that they wanted to see.			</div>

																Can't recommend this game enough so far. As someone with a budding interest over the past year or so in ImmSim type games, and as an average Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective enjoyer, this is just the perfect culmination of mechanics. This is probably the first game to call itself an ImmSim where I really felt like I had many options but no singular dominate strategy. Many choices are viable and let you play around with the very well constructed maps and tools. During my first playthrough I'm not ever feeling boxed into one playstyle or the other, I simply adapt what I do based on what's practical or fun. There's no "full stealth" or "full murder" type of story or resource incentive. It's just you and a large map to solve at your own pace. Helps that the brief amount of story that's hear is quick, snappy, to the point, and interesting, on top of some fun visuals and a handful of oddly catchy tracks.<br><br>Truly one of if not THE greatest ImmSim I've ever played, and I ain't even finished it yet. Should something happen that just ruins the game I'll update this, but otherwise assume what I've said here remains true for the whole game, just had to get my feelings out on this one, not NEARLY enough reviews here.			</div>

																i will say with no hesitation that this is one of the best immersive sims that ive ever played and also one of, if not, the best games to come out this year. it's creative as hell in its approach giving the player freedom while also restraining them to the level. that creativity has lead to some of the most organic explosions of emergent gameplay that ive had the pleasure of experiencing in a video game. ima give it a hard recommend since the game goes hard and makes me really hard.			</div>

																Ctrl Alt Ego is a wildly dynamic and creative immersive sim that absolutely nails what the genre does best. Every situation the game places you in can be solved with wild brute force, avoided entirely with clever stealth, or any manner of interesting idea you can come up with in between using the tools provided. <br><br>The body hopping nature of the player character means there's deliberately very little penalty for dying so there's no reason not to try doing whatever you like, and plenty of optional things to find to reward inquisitive play.<br><br>If you have any interest in this type of game at the very least try the demo, the trailer alone doesn't do it justice.			</div>

																One of the best gaming experiences I've had in a long while. I'm still not done with the game at the time of writing, but ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. The entire thing oozes creativity. It may not be the prettiest game, but the GAME more than makes up for it. The level of freedom you are given in this game, as far as how to solve a problem, is staggering. Just when you think you broke it with something you did, you realize a new way to get out of the problem you've put yourself in. The voice acting and story is pretty charming and funny too. Very British.<br><br>It's kind of like a weird mixture of Deus Ex, Portal, and Prey and I cannot get enough of it. I'm seriously struggling to think of issues with the game. Definitely get it if you like immersive sims and want something unique. Even if you just like a game that lets you play it how you want and get very creative, I'd pick it up. Will definitely be keeping an eye on these devs.			</div>

																Una joya oculta, si estás leyendo esto es porque llegaste a la página del juego, no es un juego para todos, pero si eres la clase de personas que disfruta de "jugar bajo tus propias reglas" y quieres probar algo diferente no dudes en darle, siendo más técnico una experiencia de simulador inmersivo que refresca el género de una manera única.			</div>

																I feel bad for not leaving a review for this, I think it deserves a shot.<br>First of all, there's a demo, steam://install/1820820, it's under the "Is this game relevant to you?" section on the right-hand side of the Steam store page, above the info box going over that it's a singleplayer game with steam achievements, full controller support, captions, cloud etc.<br>Even if the style might not seem like your thing, just give the demo a go, the save from the demo will be compatible with the full game so you can easily continue if you do like it.<br><br>I know it's done to death comparing games with other games ("It's like Skyrim with guns" "Souls-like") but, not sure how to make a quick snappy sales pitch without something that can grab peoples attention.<br>There's something very british about this (no not just the voice actor), I have flashbacks to Douglas Adams and his funny writings about depressed robots and sighing doors, maybe the retro vibe also, like I vaguely remember seeing an old TV series of Hitchhikers guide to the Galaxy and I feel like this almost fits. Also, picture if Portal and Typhon/Prey 2017 had a weird retro baby, because this is a light-hearted puzzle game with sentient fickle robots, but you have a lot more freedom than a Portal puzzle chamber ever gave you.<br>You can get a shotgun and solve all your problems that way if you want, or get thrusters and literally fly and rocket into things, or telekinesis arms to lift up heavy objects, or turn other objects into bombs, or "download" and rematerialize new copies of other things, you'll be jumping around everything, almost everything is done in-game, saving is a station you control to go save at, doors you jump to, security systems-- There's so much, and the game has a very encouraging relaxed sense of just trying to assure you at all times that you're not doing anything wrong, even "dying", just experiment, explore, look around, figure things out how you want.<br>And there's a story, seems neat, I haven't played it a ton yet, not sure how long this game is, but it's pretty fun and engaging and cute. <br>You do have to be in a puzzly mood, so that's why I haven't played it through yet.<br><br>Stop looking at the screenshots, they undersell what an inventive immersive-sim-puzzle game this is, if you like being creative and like any of the stuff I mentioned above (Portal, Prey, Douglas Adams) then I mean at least give the demo a shot, okay, what can you lose?			</div>

																Picked it up today and haven't been able to put it down all afternoon. Had me engaged from the absolute outset- a great example of immersive sim design that gives broad leeway in how you engage with hostiles and navigate through the space. The story and world are interesting and consistently well written, with a sense of humor that is both absurd and restrained, making for some very genuinely funny moments. The gameplay is fun an encourages creativity with both your toolset and the environmental design. I look forward to playing more, I'd highly recommend you pick it up			</div>

																...I mean... When does the ''Immersive Sim'' part come in?<br>Ctrl Alt Ego is one of those game that I found out when searching for a new ''Immersive Sim'' to fall in love with, and although the game is actually really good... This feels like a really complex puzzle game more than anything else.<br>Don't get me wrong: the game offers multiple ways to solve a particular problem (…although, usually, ONE solution is way better than the others), and it does have player freedom in its mindset... but again, the entire premises of the game falls flat when (especially in higher difficulties) the options are not that ''equally'' effective ( I mean, I get it. It's not a RPG... but every single time you approach a puzzle - yep, that s what they are - the optimal solution is just… one).<br>Beside that, the game is interesting in its story, design and whatnot, and it's definitely worth checking it out (this is why I'm giving it the thumbs up - it really deserves it), despite its ''junkiness'' in some feature, like player movement, revolting camera, and the overall ''unpolishness'' of some of the mechanics (shooting especially).<br>So... yes! a thrilling... PUZZLE game, with a sprinkle of Immersive Sim right there.			</div>

																A bit rough the edges, but so much fun to play.<br><br>The gameplay puts a lot of emphasis on letting you come up with your own solutions to levels, and it's really fantastic at that. It makes the gameplay engaging in a way that few games manage to be. If you enjoy thinking about the best way to solve a problem, exploring environments, trying out ideas, and formulating the perfect plan, you'll love this game.<br><br>At several turns, I was surprised that the game was even bigger than I expected. My single playthrough took around 20 hours, but the gameplay offers so much choice that I'm looking forward to doing another playthrough.<br><br>The story is good, with a few fun twists, good voice acting and a bit of philosophy about what it means to have an identity.<br><br>It's good!			</div>

																For the price I was expecting some fairly simplistic and janky im-sim gameplay, I was pleasantly surprised, so pleasant in fact that I almost nutted my pants. This game legitimately punches above its weight and can hang with the likes of Thief II and OG Deux Ex. I am just finishing up my playthrough and will be doing another directly afterwards.<br><br>You play as a...thing that can control and jump between various robots and devices in order to bypass security and accomplish various objectives on a space station, though there is a "main" bot you'll be controlling/upgrading/sneaking/shotgunning/accidentally exploding or disintegrating over the course of the game. Levels are large and highly interconnected, with tons of hidden routes and secrets to find. There are a variety of tools you can use to traverse the environment and deal with unfriendly bots, and all of them are viable as long as you explore and replenish your resources. You can sneak your way through the entire game, or install a shotgun and grenades to blast everything in your path, or upgrade your bot's thrusters and drill to disassemble and smash enemies with your robot body, or hack unfriendly bots and make them help with combat or traversal, it's all a matter of finding the pieces on the board and figuring out how you want to manipulate them to accomplish your goals. There is something of a boss fight at one point, and this may be the only im-sim that handled this in a way where you are not shoehorned into one of a few pre-set paths and just get boned if your build doesn't quite fit, you can use basically any of the game systems to beat it including finding ways to completely break and bypass it.<br><br>As far as story/writing/world-building goes, there's enough to sink your teeth into, but not as rich and meaty as something like Dishonored or Deus Ex. The tone is much more lighthearted and comedic than most im-sim games, and thankfully it steers well clear of cringy/whacky one-liners with a giant signpost saying "HEY THIS IS THE JOKE PLEASE LAUGH NOW", its mostly just dry and silly background details you'll stumble upon and chuckle, more like the humor in Portal as opposed to something like Borderlands or Saints Row.<br><br>Performance-wise I have no complaints, I've had no crashes, no bugs (or none that I've noticed at least), and a stable 60+ framerate at 1440p with a Ryzen 3600 + RXT3070. I do get occasional stuttering or framedrops when a lot of explosions and physics objects are interacting on-screen, but they are infrequent and frankly for a game this systematically complex being developed by an absolutely tiny team, the performance is impressive.<br><br>I waited until this game was discounted to buy it, but honestly after playing it I regret waiting, the full-price of $20 is a great deal for the amount of fun you'll have even in a single playthrough.			</div>

Tout d’abord les Pup, des petits chiens robot qui me permettent de me faufiler un peu partout, d’explorer le terrain furtivement, d’ouvrir des portes et même d’aboyer pour attirer l’attention.<br>Chaque Pup a son propre petit nom.<br><br>Ensuite j’ai les Bugs, des robots qui n’ont pas forcément leur place en ces lieux. Plus particulièrement, j’ai Bug 22. C’est lui mon réceptacle principal, que je peux upgrader pour obtenir de nombreux outils.<br><br>Bien évidemment, je ne suis pas le bienvenu, l’environnement n’accepte pas ma présence et divers systèmes de sécurités et entités hostiles sont en place. Si je peux les contrôler et profiter de leurs capacités, cela se fait au prix d’une ressource : l’Ego, au sens propre comme figuré.<br><br>L’Ego s’obtient dans, l’environnement, la prise de contrôle de certaines machines, la destruction de mes adversaires, la découverte de secrets. <br>Je parlais plus haut de double sens, c’est car j’ai compris assez rapidement que gaspiller mon Ego pour trouver une solution implique aussi de perdre une part d’égo de moi même, le joueur. Car en étant malin, en déployant de bonnes tactiques avec tous les outils que j’ai en main, en exécutant avec brio mes plans, en observant et en découvrant, je peux surmonter bien des épreuves sans gaspiller mon Ego dans le jeu.<br><br>Deux autres ressources sont utiles, l’Energie des hôtes (et objets) que je vais contrôler, qui est en quelque sorte leur santé et influence leurs mouvements et formes et le Juice de mon Bug 22, qui est utilisé pour alimenter ses capacités.<br><br>Si le jeu se déroule en plusieurs chapitres, je peux me balader librement entre les différents niveaux et y revenir quand je le désire si je le souhaite. Il y a des chargements entre les niveaux mais on conserve tout objet que l’on déplace.<br>Ces niveaux sont souvent liés entre eux de manière cohérente; via une multitude d'embranchements. Ensemble, ils constituent 3 faux mondes ouverts, un peu comme Prey, en restant quand même bien éloigné du génie architectural au budget AAA de Talos.<br><br>Le level design est bon, déjà par toutes les possibilités offertes sur les niveaux les plus ouverts (les premiers niveaux sont plus linéaires), la verticalité et les secrets. Mais aussi car je peux débloquer plein de raccourcis et chemins, qui sont utiles au backtracking ou pour passer outre les dangers.<br>Il y a un chapitre/lieu en particulier qui est une belle claque grâce à son immensité et sa richesse.<br><br>Les chapitres rythment une histoire assez meta et cryptique au début, dont je ne vais rien dévoiler ici.<br><br><div class="bb_h2">Surabondance d’Inputs et Outputs</div><br>A l’instar de divers autres immersive sim, l’observation et l’infiltration sont de la partie. Je passe donc mon temps à déjouer les systèmes de sécurité, tromper les ennemis et analyser le terrain avant de m’avancer.<br>L’IA est attentive aux mouvements d’objets et bruits qu’ils peuvent émettre dans leur manipulation. Plus on éveille les soupçons d’une entité, plus elle est alerte.<br>Mais ici il n’est pas question de jouer avec les ombres ou de se pencher, il est nécessaire d’utiliser de la physique (par exemple placer judicieusement des containers qui peuvent obstruer le champ de vision d’un adversaire) et des multiples aptitudes de nos hôtes.<br>Bien sûr, le fait d’être un système immatériel qui peut sauter entre plusieurs éléments anodins de l’environnement m’aide aussi.<br><br>L’immersive sim peut prendre bien des formes, Prey avait celle de l’immersive sim créatif.<br>Par ce terme je catégorise les titres qui vont m’offrir plein d’outils et me permettre de créer des pièges et solutions innovantes.<br>Beaucoup parlent d’immersive sim puzzle, si c’est assez juste dans l’idée de résoudre des problématiques, je n’aime pas trop cette dénomination car un puzzle, pour moi, a une connotation de solution unique.<br>A l’inverse, tout le sel de ces jeux est d’offrir plein de solutions et de laisser le joueur libre de ses tactiques.<br><br>Vous l’aurez compris, Ctrl Alt Ego est un immersive sim créatif et même plus que ça, il en est un des plus grands représentants !<br><br>Tout d’abord, il est doté d’un moteur physique qui gère la plupart des éléments disponibles dans l’environnement (et même nos hôtes). Je passe ainsi mon temps à jouer avec tout ce qui est disponible dans l’environnement. <br>A chaque affrontement, à chaque problème, il est question de physique.<br>Un pack d'énergie trop loin m’oblige à me mettre à découvert ? Je peux, entre autres, l’attirer avec le super aspirateur de Bug 22.<br>Un accès en hauteur empruntable par un Pup ? Je peux, entre autres, en jeter un dedans<br>Un piège à bug (mine) sur mon chemin ? Je peux, entre autres, le faire voler à vive allure vers un adversaire avec système d’impulsion de Bug 22.<br>J’énonce ici des exemples simples, cela devient particulièrement passionnant quand on combine les solutions et effets.<br><br>L’autre particularité qui rend le jeu créatif concerne les capacités offertes par les robots et principalement Bug 22. Celles-ci sont assez originales et ouvrent bien des possibilités.<br>Par exemple, il est possible d’introduire une erreur (fault) dans un objet ou entité, ce qui le rendra explosif au moindre contact en mouvement. J’aime l’appliquer sur un débris de robot, pour ensuite le jeter sur un autre ennemi ou le mettre sur son chemin.<br><br>Rarement un jeu m’a autant offert la possibilité de combattre mes adversaires sans utiliser la moindre arme. <br>D’ailleurs, si Bug 22 peut obtenir une arme à feu, c’est une capacité comme les autres. On est libre de débloquer les capacités de son choix, dans l’ordre que l’on souhaite, et donc de jouer sans aucune arme.<br><br><div class="bb_h2">Le bug est dans les détails</div><br>La suite est disponible ici : <a class="bb_link" href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fforum.canardpc.com%2Fthreads%2F136434-Ctrl-Alt-Ego-Mon-tardis-au-fond-du-Prey" target="_blank" rel=" noopener">Forum CanardPC</a><span class="bb_link_host">[forum.canardpc.com]</span>			</div>

																Podría hablar de que es uno de los mejores imsims de los últimos años. De que todo su apartado artístico no sólo es coherente sino también cautivador a su forma. O que mezcla humor ♥♥♥ un sistema que te hará empezar a buscar formas variadas de resolver situaciones de lo más satisfactorio.<br><br>Pero para no liarnos mucho lo resumo en lo siguiente: Se trata de uno de esos raros juegos ♥♥♥ personalidad propia tan marcada que, a poco que te guste lo que propone, pasado el tiempo lo seguirás recordando gratamente. Y eso hoy en día ya es mucho.			</div>

																This game is an immersive sim, think games like Deus Ex, System Shock, Arx Fatalis, Prey (2017) and a great one at that. It may not have the production values of larger titles, but as an indie game it is a triumph. If you enjoy games that present you with problems and give you multiple ways of solving them with lots of different toys, then this game is for you. Buy it, review it, support it, love it. We need more games like this, we need more immersive sims!			</div>

																the best game of 2022. incredible that there's finally another immersive sim to stand up against the classics like Deus Ex, System Shock 2, and Prey, and it's an indie title made by two people! seriously indie immersive sims have been going insane! my favorite game of last year, cruelty squad, was another indie imsim title as well... maybe this genre is just. idk. good! <br><br>incredibly witty, fun, and brainmelting, ctrl alt ego is perhaps one of the smartest puzzle shooters i've played in years, and stole my heart the moment i saw that low polygon emu. robots!! offkilter comedy!!! conspiracy!!! better than deathloop, probably!! check it out!			</div>

																This game is for you if you:<br>- like immersive sims.<br>- enjoy being creative in solving problems.<br>- know basics of software developement/programming.<br><br>This game is probably not for you if you:<br>- need AAA graphics.<br>- want smooth gameplay and don't like clunkiness. (If you liked Deus Ex: Human Revolution or MD but didn't enjoy the original Deus Ex.)<br>- like games with lots of dialogues... or any dialogues, for that matter.<br>- hate cats.<br><br> Some positives:<br>- The game world is consistent and makes sense.<br>- It is really funny. (I know it's not something I wanted from the game, but it took me quite by surprise how joyful was the experience. Also the jokes are not thrown into your face, which is definitely a plus.)<br>- The game is longer than it looks like, and in the second half it really opens up.<br>- It is not only great immersive sim game by itself, but it offers new mechanics and concepts for the whole genre.<br>- There is a demo with the Prologue and first two levels.<br><br>Some negatives:<br>- The opening is not so good. The Prologue (first level) is quite hard by itself (especially if you want to play stealthily), you are trying to learn the controls, get used to the clunkier elements (since a lot of the game is physics driven)... it is a bit messy. And even if the game tells you that you can skip the level, you don't really want to do that, do you? After that it gets much better, but it still throws at you CATs and GODs and EMUs while you teleport around and try to understand why you can control some things and not the others. It took me a while before everything started making more sense.<br>- The performance can be not great on less powerful machines. I played the game on Steam Deck and while most of the game was fine at steady 30 FPS, in some situations it dropped quite a bit, mainly in later bigger levels (especially in the last one).<br>- While the game is very flexible and gives you a lot of options how to solve problems, it also oftens offers you a specific approach for solving it (even in later parts of the game) and I have mixed feelings about that.			</div>

																TLDR: Great stuff, definitely worth trying. I bought the game even before finishing free demo, which alone contains more than many full games.<br><br>One of the best games I have ever had luck to find by pure accident. Original and unique idea, not simple, not overcomplicated, but definitely satisfying and addictive.<br><br>Base premise speaks for itself:<br>You play as a computer bug (mostly), but you can also be a pup or a door. Or, you can play as something that is usually your enemy. And your enemies are dads, mums, computer viruses, security cams, or other computer bugs chasing after you with disassembler in their hand.<br><br>Sounds too weird and bizzare? Well, it's less than you would think.<br>The world you are in is fairly complex and challenging, but not difficult to navigate and you will soon get used to its specific features. You can even fly around, which is always a sign of good level design. Your actions do not feel repetitive, because you have many options and you can always use variety of different ways to deal with the situation. This naturally provides for good replayability. Generous save system (well, maybe a bit too generous) allows you to casualy play from time to time without being limited by poorly located checkpoints, as well as to try different approaches ad nausea.<br><br>I came accross a few glitches, none of them was gamebreaking and some could even be accepted as part of experience. Controls seemed clunky at first, but then I realized it is probably on purpose. Game contains a lot of reading material, usually not necessary unless you want to know the complete story.<br><br>And last, but not least, very good technical state. Many features, that some people can find unpleasant, can be adjusted in settings. The game natively supports superwide screen resolution, which is not obvious for many AAA wannabes. And it is created and continuously maintained by devoted developers (two?!) who clearly know what they are doing. That gives me hope for a lot of future DLCs with new levels, missions and maybe new features.<br><br>Even if the game was abandoned tomorrow, it is already excellent stuff worth buying.			</div>

																Ctrl Alt Ego is equally as good as System Shock 2, Deus Ex (including GOTY), or Prey. It might not have the production values of a AAA immersive sim, but it offers more gameplay choices than any other immersive sim I've ever played. Without being disrespectful to Looking Glass Studios, Ion Storm, or Arkane Studios, I had more fun with Ctrl Alt Ego than I did with either of those aforementioned games.<br><br>Ctrl Alt Ego is a literal playground of possibilities.			</div>

																Si te gusta los shooters y el humor absurdo, creo que este podría ser tu juego jajaja.<br>Me gusto este juego, es algo confuso, pero es divertido (No entendí muy bien el final pero bueno), te permite elegir las estrategias que te gusten y tiene una duración de gameplay de más o menos 6 - 7 horas (Aunque a mi me tomo mas lol).			</div>

																Very good immersive sim type game that gives you a ton of different options for solving problems and lets you experiment with them for yourself. At one point I thought I'd blocked my progress by destroying a couple of dads then after a while playing around I found two other ways to accomplish what I needed to do. It's very well made, haven't encountered any bugs so far (except the ones you control in the game!), the mechanics work well and the voice acting is good. Incredible quality for a solo developer. Recommended if you enjoy Thief, Deus Ex, Dishonored, Prey, anything like that.			</div>

																This game is fantastic! It has huge interconnected levels, with tons of interesting lore and upgrades to find. I had a grand old time exploring every nook and cranny of these levels while dodging hostile bots and scouting out the best path forward. The upgrades are sometimes deceptively useful (I had a lot of fun hurling bug traps and canisters at my enemies, and the "download" ability was handy to teleport through small gaps). This game needs more visibility, so if you like games like Deus Ex, Dishonored or Prey, I think you'd like this too! It certainly scratched that itch for me.			</div>

																This is a hidden gem. One of the better immersive sims out there.<br><br>It's crazy that there are so many different ways to tackle every objective. It's even <i><b>more</b></i> crazy that the dev took all of them into account so that no matter what you do, you always feel like you're forging your own path forward.<br><br>The only negative thing I can say is that the look and feel absolutely take some getting used to. Thankfully there are plenty of options to tone down some of the more disorienting things like sliding movement or camera distortions.			</div>

																<b>This review does not contain any spoilers.</b><br><br>Ctrl Alt Ego is a finely crafted immersive sim with a focus on creative problem-solving.<br><br>It's got sprawling levels with different paths - and just like levels, problems can also be approached in different ways. It's got a wide range of abilities to unlock that can open up new avenues to traverse and abuse the environment and its inhabitants. Sabotage or directly confront, turn robots against one another or sneak past everything unseen!<br><br>There are apparently also ways to bypass some of the main story missions, I know two ways exist to bypass one specific mission but I have not figured out how yet. For me, that's super exciting.<br><br>Story-wise it's not that unique, filled with some tired tropes, but it takes an interesting turn down the line. The voice acting is stellar (some of it voiced by the main dev himself, very impressive!)<br><br>Toss in a bucket-load of IT terminology and jokes, British humour and Doctor Who-esque designs and you've got yourself a slightly ugly but very charming game with a ton of <i>S O V L</i> and creativity.<br><br>I love that the keybindings are tailored for PC and themed according to the game, ie to go into "control mode" to select a robot to inhabit, you do it by pressing "CTRL" on your keyboard! Similarly, CTRL+Home makes you control your primary robot. The ability "Shift" is triggered by your "Shift" key. This is so so brilliant! (Of course you could play this with a gamepad but WHY WOULD YOU?!)<br><br>I almost finished the game, but I didn't like my build and choices I made so I restarted from scratch and really loved replaying it. I have never ever done this before, and I also never replay games, but this game was even more enjoyable the second time around, because understanding the design language of the game allowed me to notice opportunities I had not before, and abuse the mechanics to their full potential. My second time with the game has been phenomenal, and the last two levels really blew my mind (in my first run I quit just before them!)<br><br>This is one of the rarer games that use achievement descriptions as a way to pique player interest and encourage them to do unusual things, for example there is an achievement that suggests an alternate way of completing a mission objective, and another implies that there is a way to bypass a segment of a seemingly mandatory story segment.<br><br>If you like to be creative, like imsims, British humour, IT jokes, robots, sci-fi, Doctor Who, Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy or any combination thereof, this game is for you. Just don't forget to bring your smarts.			</div>

																<b><div class="bb_h1">Ctrl Alt Ego Is One Of The Better Gaming Experiences I've Had In Recent Memory</div><br>With its fair amount of uniqueness and quickness, the only way I can describe this piece is as the aftermath of a rough, drunk, unprotected sex session between a puzzle game like Portal and a sci-fi immersive sim like Prey. It's the most 'immsimmy' immersive sim game on the market, if that makes any sense. The player creativity here is equal to none – so great that, in some aspects, it's even a sandbox game of some sort.The puzzle-like structure here is top-notch too; it's consistent throughout the whole experience, and the fact that it's infused with some sandbox elements just adds to the almost infinite ways you can deal with each scenario. Whether it's going hog-wild on some robot enemies or actually using your brain and controlling them with EGO, which brings me to the next topic in my review: the game mechanics. Ctrl Alt Ego's combat consists of basic tools like a teleportation device, a shotgun, and even a vacuum cleaner (it's the absolute best tool, believe me). But most importantly, the EGO system sets this game apart. In this game, you control an entity that can hijack the body of any electronic device in the game by using a currency called EGO. By hijacking enemies, you can open up an infinite amount of player approach options for any scenario in each level.To this day, I still can't grasp the fact that this masterclass was made by only two (but incredible) individuals. I cannot recommend it enough, and if you're reading this, please go and support this awesome project – it's truly one of a kind.<br>Rating: 10/10, it's incredible</b>			</div>

Somehow, Mindthunk made a deep, inventive, silly, and incredibly FUN immersive sim that stacks up to the likes of AAA competition like Deathloop or Bioshock. At first glance, you've got adorable robots, a great bodyswapping gimmick, and dry British humor - but as the game progresses, the storyline becomes far more dark and philosophical. It's a playground that lets you CTRL almost anything, and a game that really puts the 'immersive' in immersive sim. A truly polished indie gem that deserves far more recognition!<br><br><div class="dynamiclink_box " onclick="DynamicLink_PlayYouTubeVideoInline( this, &quot;Q2jHSEluR34&quot; );">

																For a 1-2 man passion project, Ctrl Alt Ego is an incredible achievement. It's janky in parts, sure, and the performance isn't great, but it's a full length game with quality that actually IMPROVES the further in you get, and the sort of level design and systemic gameplay that makes it truly deserve its Immersive Sim label. Not only that, it actually innovates on classic imm sim design in a meaningful and unique way with its ego hopping mechanic, instead of simply imitating what came before it. (Not that I have any issue with that, mind - we could certainly do with more games that do a good job at aping the classics!)<br><br>As with most of these games, I strongly recommend turning off the floating objective markers. As with Prey and Dishonored and Deathloop, exploring the environment is a key part of the experience, and reducing your experience to chasing floating icons does the game a huge disservice. The game world is clearly designed with a lot of care and consideration, and I never found myself frustrated or completely disoriented. <br><br>I would have loved to see more types of robots with unique movement styles to possess instead of relying on Bug 22 and hopping between static machines so much, but I can't fault the devs for not adding even more features to an already packed game. Ctrl Alt Ego is up there with the big budget greats, and I hope MindThunk can continue making games like this in the future.			</div>

																I don't know where to begin with this. I've been holding off writing a review because I didn't have the words to describe how addicting and incredible this is. Ctrl Alt Ego is a hidden gem, and criminally underrated. This is a true immersive sim that sits right up there with some of the classics such as Thief, Prey 2017 and Dishonored in the way it feels playing it, while having its own unique mechanics. <br><br>There are many, many ways to approach a situation. There is plenty of room for emergent gameplay.. Every dead end has a solution. Every seemingly sealed off room has a way in. <br><br>With only a 2-person team, it's astonishing how much level of IMAGINATION it takes to write or design something like this. There's plenty of "aha" moments, and the game feels long, but by the time it ends, it leaves you wanting more. <br><br>The writing is smart, punny, endearing. A delightful charm from beginning to the end, leaving a wide grin from ear to ear. The game feels like a cute puzzle game at first, but eventually gets ponderous, existential, darker, stepping a little towards survival horror at times. The funny messages become cryptic, serious, and even heartbreaking. The lore is only there if you seek it out. There is plenty of fodder for lore-essay youtubers to sink their teeth into.<br><br>Best of all, the developer Mindthunk is incredibly active in engaging with the community, and continues to refine and update this even as of writing. We need more games like this in the genre. Steam's "Immersive Sim" tag has far too many non-immersive sims drowning it. <br><br>We need more youtubers to cover this than just Charlatan Wonder. Send this to Civvie 11, Boulder Punch, SuperHorrorBro, MandaloreGaming, Joseph Anderson. If you played this game and enjoyed it, please leave a review so that it gets up in the rankings.			</div>

																I cannot imagine how I missed this game prior to watching Charlatan Wonder.<br><br>Long story short, the game's really great. From the writing to the gameplay mechanics, it's a blast to play through. The things you can do are even more open ended than your run of the mill immersive sims, to the point where I might even say it comes very close to being a sandbox game.<br><br>Highly, HIGHLY recommend it.			</div>

																 Brilliant level design, unique and creative mechanics, tons of secrets to discover, surprisingly deep story, and lots of ways to progress! You can do full stealth, or fight aggressively. Both styles are fun. I usually do a mix of both.  This game is amazing and I hope more people find it. <br><br>I barely ever do reviews, but this game deserves so much praise. I hope the dev goes on to create more unique gaming experiences! Thank you for making this game.			</div>

																A game that fully understands and embraces what makes the imsim classics great, with its own very interesting mechanical twist and a quirky vibe that doesn't overextend itself. A real gem once you gather a couple of the abilities and the gameplay kicks into gear.			</div>

																You'll play this immersive sim and then by the time you're finished you'll wonder why this game is ONLY priced at $20 based on the quality. Props to the small team who made this as well since they knew what to prioritize and what to ignore with what was probably a small budget to begin with.			</div>

																Love the idea. Devs also clearly put a lot of care into the design and each level. But I just don't know if I can recommend buying it. I just didn't find myself being drawn into the story, and some of the gameplay felt just a bit clunky enough that it pulled me out of the experience.			</div>

																<div class="bb_h1"> TL;DR </div><br><b>+</b> 20+ hours long, including some "bonus", modified campaign missions (worth the money!)<br><b>+</b> Definite replay value (it's an immersive sim!)<br><b>+</b> It's an immersive sim! (I'm a little biased here)<br><b>+</b> Made by two (2) people! Pretty impressive scope!<br><b>+</b> Solid, in-depth mechanics. Suits all play styles!<br><b>+</b> Very open-ended game play. Emergent game play up the wazoo! Play how you want!<br><b>+</b> Great overall concept<br><b>+</b> Fantastic level design, audio design<br><b>+</b> Solid enemy AI<br><b>+</b> Great narrative (often very tongue-in-cheek)<br><br><b>-</b> Visual aesthetic is a little rough and may take some getting used to (not necessarily a big negative, except for "muh graphics" crowd)<br><b>-</b> Some slight janky Unity physics shenanigans<br><b>-</b> Plot twist is a bit cliche, or a trope, in that <span class="bb_spoiler"><span><i>spoiler in the long part!</i></span></span>, although it does tie up the narrative nicely.<br><br><hr><br><br><div class="bb_h1"> FFO: </div><br>Prey (2017)<br>Deus Ex series<br>Outer Wilds<br>Gloomwood<br>Half Life (or really anything by Valve; Portal, Gmod, etc.)<br><br><hr><br><br><div class="bb_h1"> THE LONG PART </div><br>I almost can't believe this game was made by 2 people! I'm so glad the developer replied to a Dave Oshry (I think) Twitter ♥♥♥♥ post, because this is a <b>fantastic indie immersive sim!</b><br><br><b>While initially seeming to be a little rough around the edges</b>, and the controls admittedly took a little time to get used to, <b>the prologue gives a great impression</b>, and after that, the rest of the game opens up for a truly wonderful approach to <b>allowing the player to do whatever they want</b> to reach the objective.<br><br>This game was about $30 AUD, and I think this is <b>absolutely worth the price!</b> There's 15-20 hours worth of levels for the campaign/story mode, with a couple more of some standalone, modified versions of a couple campaign missions. It seems like the developer is planning to add more of these challenges, so as of November 3 2022, stay tuned? There is also <b>obvious replay value</b> here, which involves changing the difficulty, or trying a different play style/upgrade.<br><br>The mechanics heavily rely on the emphasis on player choice, and <b>the overall scope of the game entitles the player to figure out how to get from point A to B almost entirely on their own</b>. This includes the choice of equipment upgrades, exploring the environment, handling enemies, and so on. While the game does give diegetic hints, or encourages the player to perform a specific task, these moments are few and far between.<br><br>The concept for <b>the game's world is pretty good</b>, and ties in nicely to the game mechanics. It's almost self-aware in some respects, especially in regard to the fact that the game is an immersive sim, and im-sims typically have terrible "boss fights" and endings. (No, it does NOT mention "looking glass" or "0451", as far as I saw. Maybe it should lose points for this?!) The narrative is spun along by a literal voice in a box, and as it unfolds, I start asking more questions as a mysterious series of events, and a conspiracy, comes to light. I did find it a little cliche at a certain point, and it is frankly a pretty obvious twist to guess, in that <span class="bb_spoiler"><span>the player, deuteragonist, and antagonist are all versions of the same person within the simulation</span></span>. But this doesn't detract from the experience at all.<br><br>The <b>level design is immaculate for a game of this scope!</b> It is so well fleshed out and open-ended, I am left wondering how long it took for these two devs to get out of the design phase. As the chapters progress, the <b>levels get more complicated, and even more non-linear in design.</b> There's even a few neat tricks thrown in, where I am blown away when I figure out how to clear the obstacle. <b>Audio design is great</b>; plenty of ambient, incidental music, different objects sound different, and enemies sufficiently click and/or whistle to let the player know their general location.<br><br><b>Enemy AI is very good</b>. In this type of game, enemies should react to nearby sounds, certain movements, and be sufficiently capable of guarding the area they are in. Enemies in this game are good at their job, basically. Until, of course, you take control and assimilate them into your consciousness. Or shoot them. Or sneak past them. Or blow them up. Look, there's lots of ways to "husk" or be "husked" in this game. In short, if they see you, they get bothered (literally), and spend some time pondering your existence before returning to their default state, if you leave their field of view. If they do get sufficiently concerned (again, literally), they will do everything in their power to remove you from the equation. Some enemies have their unique quirks which the player will have to deal with, including collecting an access card, or spawning more enemies upon defeat.<br><br>Overall, this is a fantastic game, I just had to leave a long-winded, formatted review here. <b>Highly recommended</b>. I love my immersive sims, and I'm loving this im-sim "renaissance" we're having. First Prey 2017, then Gloomwood, now this? These are super niche types of games, or should be, but they are exploding in popularity.<br><br>Here's to this developer making a solid game, and to more unique titles to come!			</div>

																This game is simply amazing. It's almost unbelievable that it was made by just 2 dudes, many AAA studios wouldn't be able to pull off something so well put together, everything from the gameplay to the atmosphere or the lack of bugs (I'm not referring to the playable robots, which are also called bugs xD), it all feels fresh.  It certainly deserves to be called a true immersive sim: there's that sense of freedom with emergent gameplay, different ways to tackle each objective, reactivity, the use of the environment for storytelling, it's all there. I also particularly like how there is no real death in this game, conceptually speaking this game is one of a kind. 8.75/10.			</div>

																Early review: I haven't gotten far yet, but this game lights up the same parts of my brain that Prey (2017) did when I used the GLOO Gun to circumnavigate a barrier, or the Nerf bowcaster to open a door from across the room. And that is a very, very rare and delectable treat, my friend. There are always multiple ways of completing your objective, and that just sends my brain into a dopamine tizzy. <br><br>And let's not forget that this was put together by an incredibly small team. Plus, you've got a narrator/questgiver with the same charming accent and cadence as Oliver Sacks (if you listen to Radiolab, you've heard him); it's so charming that I start to wonder if this is a GLaDOS or SHODAN situation -- that's not a spoiler, I really don't know yet how much to trust this fellow, but I can't wait to find out.<br><br>I normally wouldn't leave a review this early in, but I feel like I want to boost this dev's engagement on Steam, because golly gee, this is a very satisfying but under-represented gem, and it's criminally negligent to let this one pass you by.			</div>

																A very creative and unique entry to the immersive sim category. It is more of a puzzle solving game than a straight shooter. It does provide the tools to go in guns blazing, but you would be missing a lot of what makes the game interesting.<br><br>The puzzles themselves ask for a good bit of exploration and creativity to solve (or bypass). The resources feel very rewarding to find, and gaining a new ability or upgrade feels immediately and obviously useful rather than a decision you can only hope will be good later. The story is charming, if a bit sidelined. It's nice to have an immersive sim that does not feel incredibly grim for once :)<br><br>The UI/UX is incredibly intuitive and well thought-out. The (unintended) bugs are minimal for me so far, and the game runs better than the specs would have you believe.<br><br>My main nitpick is that the visual design can be a bit... unattractive at times, especially with the main controllable robots. Not a deal breaker by any means, but it can be off putting before the gameplay distracts from it.			</div>

One of the most creative immersive sims to date(that I've played at least) and I would absolutely 100% recommend.  Can't wait to see what's next from this studio :)))<br>			</div>

																Absolute gem of an immersive sim. Not much time played yet on the full version but I played enough of the 4hr Demo to be able to recommend it to all and its important to get reviews out early sometimes so the game gets more coverage.<br><br>I'll be sure to update the review as I play the game but If you're looking for something very unique and fun I'd recommend giving it ago especially since you have nothing to lose but time while checking out the generous demo			</div>

																<div class="bb_h2">Unique and original game about disembodied consciousness 🤖</div><br>I rarely play puzzle or FPS games, but Ctrl Alt Ego is brilliant in so many aspects I had to make an exception ¯\_(ツ)_/¯<br><br>The core idea of disembodied consciousness, game mechanics, level design, art direction, and sounds are all great and original!<br><br>The player is given freedom in approaching various situations - brute force, stealth, and cunning are all valid paths.<br><br>Programs (skills) can be unlocked in any order and worms (upgrades) are impactful - play it your way.<br><br>The limited resources can be spent in different ways (ego to control things, juice to power tools) and their proper allocation feels important.<br><br>A mighty pleasant indie surprise, big recommendation from me 👌			</div>

																I Initially picked this up because the premise was a spot on recreation of my of my favorite first dnd characters, Rubico, a sentient ai that could transfer through physical contact and was basically a virus, and not only do you deliver on what i wanted from this game but you blew away my expectations, as well as gave me a chance to play as my boy! You can stealth, genocide, completionist, almost anything you could want.			</div>

																I honestly feel like this is what Watchdogs should've been. This is an ingenious blend of hacking, stealth, exploration, and some light role-playing. Don't expect a non-linear narrative. Expect non-linear levels with countless solutions to complete objectives and navigate safely. It's shockingly deep. You play as a disembodied EGO with the ability to jump from device to device whether it's a robot, a camera or an MP3 player. You can go as far as navigating entire levels without ever taking control of a bot. Numerous abilities are unlockable and upgradable like invisibility, telekinesis, a jetpack, a shotgun, grenades, etc. which each encourage a playstyle that the player is free to choose from. You'll never be forced to play any one way. Wanna go guns blazing? Go ahead. Wanna sneak through vents and sneak by while invisible? Knock yourself out. Wanna hack into a DAD bot to dematerialize any enemies around without having to risk losing your BUG bot? By all means, do it. This game greatly rewards the player's ingenuity and abilities are completely optional. You can get through every level without using any of your abilities. That's good game design. Despite how overwhelming it may all seem, the controls are very simple to understand and everything is explained clearly. Just hold Ctrl and then left click the thing you want to hack into. Even when there's a lot of hackable devices around you, you can easily set a filter for only specific types of devices making it easier to jump to the device your targeting. The game throws PLENTY of hints your way on how to progress. Arguably too many hints. Nonetheless, this is founded on experimentation and is more of a stealth puzzle game than a FPS. There's only one gun and it handles dreadfully. Don't expect strong presentation here. Environments are visually identical with more or less the same enemies over and over again. There are no cutscenes THANKFULLY. The story is told through audio logs and readable notes. The narrative goes in a much more humorous direction and it is very British. The voice acting for Dr. Everyman is great. Props there. I also have to compliment the excellent soundtrack which reminded me of Kraftwerk a bit. The performance of the game is more mixed. The game is clearly having to process a lot and the performance tanks in busier environments especially when going to hack. There's also numerous bugs (no pun intended). I've glitched out of the level entirely numerous times. Even enemies do it sometimes. It's not game-breaking as it is preventable, but expect a lot of jank in a game as highly ambitious, but still indie as this. The camera can be nauseating for one thing since this game simulates a 3D body in first person. Movement is floaty, intentionally, since your Bug hovers around. It takes some getting used to. Climbing stairs is especially headache inducing. Every mission is highly replayable and customizable. It can easily take at least an hour to fully explore every nook and cranny of the level. You feel like a genius when you overcome a difficult section through your own creativity. I appreciate devs encouraging players to engage in the systems they program into the game instead of holding our hand and telling us what to do. This is a strong recommendation from me. If I had to score it, I'd give it an 8/10.			</div>

																Jump from device to device, and control robots to sneak, hack or shoot your way through some well designed levels. Can be overwhelming at times and the controls somewhat iffy.

																Fantastic level design, both in aesthetic and puzzle design.<br>Game mechanics are unique and satisfying; offering many avenues for level completion.<br>Sound is outstanding, in particular the voice acting is smashing, the music is tasteful, and the effects are fun.<br>Have probably completed nearly half the game so far, it progressively gets more involved.<br>Would at least recommend trying the demo if you are interested.			</div>

																I've been watching this game development status on twitter for quite some time.  It's concept of mind control and jumping between entities is a great one for a puzzle game, bringing back memories of the Abe's Odyssey series about prop hunt games.  Despite this great gameplay idea I was concerned about how this would work in practice.  Now I have my hands on the game I know I didn't need to worry!  The transition between entities is smooth and it's simple to understand and it's very easy to get into playing around with the movement to explore your locations.  The only warning I would add is that it may cause issues for people with motion sickness so maybe there could be an option were the transitions are simplified or removed?<br>The developer needs to get particular praise for the lack of hand-holding and direction in exploring and solving the puzzles.  Go completely the wrong way and you get a simple prompt to "return to area X", but otherwise go ahead and wander around.  Sneak?  Sure.  Destructive progress?  Fine.  Fly over obstacles?  Blow them up?  Hey. play to your style and pick the skills you want, it's all good.<br>Lastly, humour.  I thoroughly enjoyed the puns and voice over and the little snippets of info on the datapads.  IMHO quality humour in a puzzle game like this is a massive plus.<br>Overall this game is clearly a labour of love.  MindThunk have come up with a brilliant puzzle game concept and now they just want the player to have fun in their world.  A wonderful indiedev title.			</div>

																What a wonderful game. I played this twice, back to back I loved it so much, rummaging around every corner to find every secret passage, power up and lore drop. <br><br>The world-building, the agency, finding your own way through, the quirky British nerd comedy make this really special. My first play through was shield and shotgun, in your face. The second time around was ghost and faults - touching the bad guys to make them explode. <br><br>As an indie game the graphics are serviceable, but very readable to know the state of every element in the game.<br><br>If you're a fan of action puzzle games, or immersive sims do yourself a favour and play this. I'll miss my time with Bug 22 and Dr. Everyman, but I'll boot it up again some time and find that last worm that eluded me.			</div>

																You are "Ego", some kind of consciousness that can move between every machine, computer and robot in your line of sight. You don't know <i>why</i> or <i>how</i>, but you are about to find out!<br><br>Every machine you transfer into gives you full control over it. If you move into a computer, you can access its sensitive data. You can move into a door to unlock it. Move into a bomb to detonate it.. and so on. There's also several kinds of robots with different sets of skills and tools you can transfer between as you progress.<br><br>There's so many ways to solve problems; You can be sneaky, you can place traps, you can manipulate the enemy, install useful software or devastating hacks, or use brute force. You can't even die! If you fail and your machine breaks, just transfer into another and try another route. With that said, it can still be very challenging at times.<br><br>This game is a pure and almost childish joy!<br><br>Highly recommended.<br>			</div>

																Thoroughly enjoyable immersive sim!!! <br><br>Found the story to be pleasant and overall rewarding for working through the game. The art and music were both charming and quite fitting. Really enjoyed the main bug model.<br><br>The game play was pretty darn good if you were playing a little slower/stealthy. There were decent number of routes and lots helpful objects/data/keys. The game felt pleasing on a gut level when you solve a puzzle, and clever when you find a quicker route. For the most part you don't wander too blindly with sufficient quest markers and in game signage. I might have put a few more, but you get quite a lot of hints and helpful pointers throughout the game. The skill system was adequate, but the skills themselves were very good with each one having distinct uses/play styles. You can get a quite a few skills and skill points if you are thorough.<br><br>Not all peaches and cream. I hated having to carry anything through a tube or pick up the grill plates blocking them. There is a little bit of jank, and it got me killed a few times. Pacing, there is a slightly too slow build up for an end that overstays. I liked the difficulty spikes, but they could be rough on the first play through. I would not want to play the game without the float skill.<br><br>really enjoyed it overall even after a few frustrating parts			</div>

																Wow this is a fantastic game!!!! I have played all the classic immersive sims; this is as good as any and in many ways better. There are so many ways to get this game done and I have been at it for a generous amount of time, all well spent. I feel a new wave of excitement in this genre. There must be more of these immersive sims created… please; this game has set the standard.			</div>

																This is a very fun, unique, interesting, and creative immersive sim that falls into all the usual shortcomings that immersive sims are known to have! <br>Combat becomes easier than stealth around the mid-game and never does stealth catch up to combat in its ease. The final boss is piss-easy. It's quite possible to soft-lock yourself in many scenarios and circumstances, and if you make too much accidental forward progress it becomes nearly impossible to go back and see where that particular option soft-locks.<br><br>The story is nothing to write home about. The enemies are repetitive. The puzzles are exquisite, and that immersive sim *feeling* of wading through a room, half in stealth, half violently cleaning up anyone who spots you or your path, is strong here. It's very, very satisfying. <br><br>I'd say this is a real quality 7/10. Closer to an 8 than a 6.			</div>

																Absolutely stellar game. Bought from recommendation by Charlatan Wonder, so I guess the dev has him to thank for a buttload of buys.<br><br>Brilliant IMSIM game, very fun to "figure out", funny and lots of options on how to approach every single situation. Definitely up there with the giants of the genre.<br><br>Only real negative is the performance. Performance is stinky. Sometimes the game is running at 120+ fps, and sometimes like 50 in some areas. (last area in particular is pretty bad)<br><br>Anyway highly recommend to anyone who likes good games.			</div>

																This game could really use a UX overhaul, better controller support and some serious optimization. It's still an excellent and unique game in its current state that's well worth your time if you're at all interested in Immersive Sims or other games with a lot of player agency.			</div>

																I love the concept and the creativity, but every aspect of the game is so janky and controls are so frustratingly inaccurate, it ruined the experience for me. The "immersive sim" label is a bit of a stretch.			</div>

																Take caution while playing it if you have motion sickness. Ctrl alt ego is a very interesting and fun game which has some great accessability options for ppl with motion sickness, the dev (or devs, unsure about that part) is taking the feedback regarding any nausea related issues with the visuals and tweaking the game appropriately so he's a really cool dude			</div>

																This game is not for everyone. And that includes me. Mechanically it's decent but I don't know it could me turned into being more ... playable.<br><br>Overall it's a bit of a mess visually, which is not really a problem but I think it contributes to being a bit confusing. Other problem is that every single thing takes way more effort that in would in a regular video game. It is in the spirit of the game but it gets into the way of gameplay.			</div>

																Ctrl Alt Ego is one of the best concepts imaginable developed by the least competent people imaginable.<br><br>It's playable ENTIRELY on the strength of its concept, even as it attempts to bungle the execution of it at every possible turn.<br><br>The pitch is that you are a disembodied mind that jumps from device to device as you try to disable/avoid the facility's guardians and eventually do... something vague that I kind of missed. When possessing your "primary" form, the BUG, you also get some special powers that are liberally lifted from Dishonored, Prey, etc. there's nothing original there but it's all stand-bys of the genre it attempts to be.<br><br>See, that's another thing to address. I've seen people call this an immersive sim, I think even some of the marketing material does, but it isn't. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ aside, an immersive sim is about being in a believable environment that you can see as something other than a gameplay level, as a work environment, lab or living space, and then interacting with believable things. The environments in CAE are more like Portal levels. This isn't to say this is bad by itself, I loved Portal and Portal 2, I just feel like it misrepresents what the game is.<br><br>Anyway, this all sounds pretty good so far, right? <br><br>Well too bad, they screwed it up.<br><br>Firstly, you've got a game that often involves physics manipulations where the physics are awful. Even while doing something as simple as riding an elevator, your possessed item will attempt to topple over. Physics objects regularly block necessary items. Carried objects will occasionally simply choose to clip outside of the level. Sometimes you carry something and it just explodes in your face. <br><br>Secondly, the UI is designed in some sort of very specialized circle of Hell. Possessing something always leaves you looking at a wall or similar, no matter how the object is otherwise facing, and any time there are two vaguely approximate objects to possess, it's suffering to make sure the game picks the right one. You also generally possess machines that are about two feet tall, and have to get items out of containers that are three feet tall, forcing you to battle the camera and sometimes jump on top of and into the container just to get things out of it.<br><br>Pointless possessions. You have to possess buttons to press them, and notepads to read them(while oddly enough you can read stationary computer screens just fine by walking up to them), and a number of other such pointlessly fiddly things. There are plenty of buttons in the game you just PUSH, and then piles of them that you have to possess, flipping around your PoV and making it clunky to get back to where you started. This sucks and is bad. You can't even skip some of these because even the pure "lore" items provide EGO which is one of the game's important power usage "currencies." <br><br>The game wants you to do stealth, but you're piloting something with a 50-degree FoV and all the acrobatic prowess of a beached sea cucumber, which means that even if you plot the perfect heist, you're going to get held up against a juicebox or a screwdriver. <br><br>All this comes together in a way that makes the game feel even when you're doing things right, like you're doing things wrong. Oh and I also hit one puzzle that I think is legitimately impossible without glitching it out with the right powers(which you may or may not have, still, optional puzzle) since the bot you're supposed to possess to navigate a maze can't navigate the maze, or possibly it's just that you may softlock the maze by opening a box in the wrong order.<br><br>Plus just, a bunch of other small annoying bugs like a door that resets to closed every time you reach it, and then the first time each time you press the open button it re-closes again immediately afterwards.<br><br>Lastly, but not least, there is one(1) voiced character in this game, who is omnipresent, and they found possibly the least charismatic person imaginable for this important starring role. I wanted to brain him with a wrench from the first sentence, I would rather just have read text entries than deal with that.<br><br>So long story short: It's INCREDIBLY sad that they executed the game as badly as they did, because it had WILD amounts of potential. Do better next time, maybe do even a marginal amount of beta-testing.			</div>

																Proves that sticking to a strong new vision is what's missing from today's industry. A modern classic that doesn't distract the player with classic game design conventions that end up breaking immersion. It punches way above its weight coming from a 2 person studio. Thank you for keeping this genre alive!			</div>

																Terrible performance<br><br>For some reason every time I go through a loading screen the frame-rate gets cut in half, basically rendering the game unplayable.<br><br>EDIT: did more testing it was just a Proton Problem<br><br>The game is actually awesome, it gives the player an insane amount of freedom when confronted with enemies and environmental puzzles. Played on normal difficulty it strikes the right balance between challenge and fun,and is definitely suggested for a first play-through.			</div>

																Top 3 immersive sim games ever made for sure. I have no complaints about the game and I hope more people play it so someone can write a guide on how to get some of the tricky achievements and share some story elements since I am too dumb to figure some out :&gt;			</div>

																As soon as I started playing it I knew I messed up.<br><br>Prey is my favorite game, so I bought this on the dozens of recommendations that said it was similar. What in the world are people talking about? Nothing about this game is similar to Prey in the slightest.<br><br>The graphics and physics are extremely, what's the word... cheap and unrealistic. The "immersion" is just point A to point B puzzles for the sake of being puzzles. Nothing about this game is enthralling, thought-provoking, or attention grabbing. It's like a (very) low-budget cross between Portal and The Stanley Parable, but less fun and significantly less aesthetically pleasing. I've drunkenly created more attractive environments in 30 minutes using 1999's Unreal Editor. <br><br>The difference between Prey and this game is the difference between me paying any amount of money for a game, and wishing I had stubbed my toe instead of playing it. <br><br>This game might have a great concept, but it's so under-cooked that it's painful to have it on my computer. I've already requested a refund and uninstalled it and nothing anyone says can convince me to reverse course. <br><br>I mean absolutely no disrespect to the humble, creative team who made this unique game, but the fans (maybe friends of the developers or even the developers themselves on alt accounts?) who are talking so highly about it aren't doing it any favors in the long run. Just give it a fully honest critique and please leave Prey out of your mouth. <br><br>And... run it by someone before calling it finished and putting it out there. My 2 cents.			</div>

																Unreadable graphics is too confusing for me. Enemies attacks with perfect precision so every battles wins character with more health and stronger weapon, your skill is not important at all. I'm sad, from reviews game was looking very promising and in my type! Refunded...			</div>

																I like! Expect to feel a little bit detached from the world --- this, from what I gather, is the intention. Mechanics are the main focus of this game, in my opinion. Some very fun solutions come out of it.			</div>

																Cool concept but highly tedious gameplay. Resource management, particularly EGO, encourages highly conservative gameplay which is against the alleged design intent of having many solutions in a sandbox environment. Enemy AI is also frustratingly quick to aggro, which further slows down pacing.			</div>

																There might be a good game in there somewhere, but I just cannot get around the everpresent clunkiness and how <i>incredibly</i> ugly the game is.<br><br>It's very clear that the team who made this has no artist background. The game is just ugly as sin and full of visual issues that can be easily avoided if you ask someone for help that knows this stuff. As it is, it visually has strong "babies first Unity game" vibes.			</div>

																You can beat your audience over the head all you want with how innovative and unique and amazing an imsim you are (even buying off YouTubers to say the same), but it all rather amounts to naught when your game has jankier physics and more lame crate stacking and key hunting puzzles than Jurassic Park Trespasser.  <br><br>Trespasser was funnier too.			</div>

																The game is 100% immersive and proud of it, everything can be done in as many ways as you like.<br>The gameplay gets a little repetitive towards the end, but only a little.<br>The story? It is there.<br>The music? Not much, but what is there is great!<br>I really love this game. It is definitely not for beginners in the immersive sim genre because it is 100% absolut 0 handholding, But thats not bad. Thats good!			</div>

																Was a pretty fun game overall. Obviously this is not a AAA immersive sim like the neo-deus ex games or dishonoured, etc, but it certainly carries on their spirit even if it can't match all of their breadth. There's definitely good depth to this game, but a lot of its depth lies in sort of "pushing against the simulation". so to speak. Doing things that almost don't feel intended, but are. <br><br>Pure stealth is much harder and possibly more boring than Deus Ex or Dishonoured but I don't think that's entirely a bad thing- those two games end up being more stealth games than anything else, whereas here it's much more up to you how to approach things. It almost gave me the feeling of a VR game like bonelabs, where you're just interacting with the environment without feeling like there's a way you "should" be playing the game, and a lot of people will have different experiences.<br><br>All in all, I'd recommend it. It was a good time, though I am not sure I'll replay it, partially because of how easily I got everything. Definitely a sleeper gem, though!			</div>

																So, starting out, this game is a absolute blast to play. You are given so many tools and no matter how dire things seem, there is always a solution of some sort. The levels are very well thought out with what you are given and there is no point where you are not utilizing a good portion of your kit. The story is not the absolute best or strongest writing I have seen, but it's not horrendous either. This game is well worth what you pay for it at the end of the day.			</div>

																from start to finish this game kept my intrigued, and challenged in the way i decided to get through the levels, from starting off as just a simple bot with not much to feeling like nothing could stand in your way. while i have seen some people complain about the visuals i found no issues and there are accessibility options to decrease the chance of motion sickness<br>10/10 would buy again			</div>

																Ctrl Alt Ego advertises itself as "The problem solving creativity of games like Prey, System Shock, and Deus Ex, mixed with a campy British sci-fi vibe a la Red Dwarf or Doctor Who, and incorporating stealth from games like Dishonored, Hitman, and Watch Dogs" and it backs up those claims with a very fun immersive sim that exceeded my expectations.<br><br>If you enjoy these games and shows you will not regret picking up this game.			</div>

																It's a pretty cool game with a super unique mechanic of hoping between things. It's clear there's a good amount of systems to play around with to shape your experience as you like but I'm gonna stop playing it cause it's very focused on its puzzles and that's just not my jam. Maybe if I came back and chose some of the gun modules that'd be a better playthrough for me but as it is there isn't a clear way to respec and just try new builds on the fly; it seems like you'll need whole ass new playthrough just to see how modules will work and what you'll like. You should still give it a shot and see if you enjoy it. I still think it was worth the short playtime I had with it.			</div>

																Easily the best immersive sim you will ever play, period. A great plot, tied in with excellent, innovative gameplay make for a beautiful game. Words, however, only go so far, so just buy the game, support this awesome developer,and enjoy what is most certainly the best immersive sim that exists			</div>

																This is a proper immersive sim. There is verticality. There is choice; in fact, there seem to be no incorrect choices. If you like Arkane's games (well...aside from Red Fall) you'll love this. To emphasize this more, I spent more money on my new laptop so it could play games as this game is not currently available on consoles, specifically, for CTRL ALT EGO. Lovely stuff.			</div>

																I'm going to tell you a bit about my experience with this game.<br><br>It all started with my love for Prey and looking for other immersive sym games for me to play. While looking at Dillon Rogers twitter (X) due to him developing the game I'm most excited about, I saw that he was recommending some games, one of them had a fantastic cover art that immediately caught my eye and I decided to look for it on Steam. With just 300 reviews I decided to buy it as soon as I could get a chance.<br><br>What comes after that is a great and possibly the most immersive and most impressive game I have played in a long time. It wasn't all positive at first, I tried the game for around 8 hours first, reaching the Chapter 6 and considering that it was extremely hard and even if I liked the concept of the game and mechanics that maybe it wasn't for me and that was ok. I decided to give it another chance after a couple of weeks, I restarted my playthrough and, for some unknown reason even to me, decided to up the challenge and play it on Strict. During these 21 hours (11.5 in game time) I had an amazing time and it was all due to having a different perspective on how to overcome the situations. On my first playthrough I was playing it like a shooter, getting the gun.exe first and basically shooting my way through those first six chapters and some stealth sprinkled through there. On the second playthrough I found different paths, different ways to unlock doors, hack through stuff, fly through the level being the best bodyless EGO I could be and I loved each second of it.<br><br>This game is the purest definition of a hidden gem that I have ever seen, I'm not that into making written reviews of games I just want more people to find this game and experience this incredible game. <br><br>If my review wasn't clear enough on how much I LOVE this game, or maybe you just want a quick score: 10/10.			</div>

E' una bestemmia che abbia così poche recensioni, è uno dei migliori immersive sim che abbia mai giocato, super complesso quanto intuitivo. <br><br>ENG: Guys do yourself a favor, play this game you won't regret it.

																Probably one of the most interactive sandboxes in an immersive sim. I've played many of these kinds of games and this stands out as one of the best.			</div>

																Holy moly this is SO GOOD!<br><br>Thank you for staying on the fun quirky side rather than heavy horror lean like many other games in the genre. I really like playing with the mechanics, bit don't like scary stuff (hence Prey was tough for me).<br>Ctrl alt ego is amazing. It is beautifully designed and inspires creativity. Top 3 immersive sims out there for sure			</div>

																An amazing and unique game that you absolutely need to give a try.<br>Despite the comedy that made me think the campaign wasnt very serious, the story is surprisingly interesting and good. The campaign has a very good length and a lot of replayability; i have played the game by stealthing around everything and by going head on into the enemies and both were very fun experiences.<br>The gameplay is very fun and deep once you get the basics of it, the tools are very fun and interesting to experiment with and the level design is fantastic and compliments the tools very well; you have something interesting to do with most tools in every situation, and even options for going in with no tools at all. You really can just play it however you want.<br>Definitely a game that should be played by everyone.<br>(Also the devs should sell bug plushies/figures fr fr, the design grew on me a lot the more i played)			</div>

																Spectacular game. It isn't for everyone but if you're like me and find that you've acquired a taste for hidden gems then this game is among the finest of them. It is shockingly long and open ended. There was never a moment where I felt I had too few tools, and the game enables the use of all of them. This game isn't scared of you becoming extremely powerful and even enables it by allowing the player total freedom to decide how they want to go about doing things with all of that power. <br><br>Spoilers:<br><br>Also want to mention that the ending is the perfect way to make you feel instantly trapped. Going from the total freedom of the final level, to assuming that you're going to gain EVEN MORE freedom, only to be suddenly trapped with nowhere to go felt like having all of my limbs torn off at once. Never before have I felt that way but Ctrl Alt Ego did it and for that reason it will stick in my mind. <br><br>TL;DR <br>Buy the frickin game already, man.			</div>

																Genuinely slept on this. Give the game time and you'll grow to love it. You may need to play through the first half or so until you realise the level of freedom you truly have as you may start out overwhelmed or at least confused by the unconventional game mechanics.<br><br>Please try it out. If you give it the time it deserves, you won't regret your purchase.			</div>

																This game is must play ImmSim. <br>-If you are excited by the fact that the least exciting thing to play with is the gun, then buy this game. <br>-If you ever have considered being a thought and having only consciousness as your body, or ever found that appealing, then buy this game. <br>-If you ever played Prey (2017), and you liked it even remotely, then buy this game. You won't be disappointed. <br>-You will get lost for hours just exploring and looking for secrets, I promise you. <br>-The humour is sublime.<br>-10/10			</div>

																**heavy British accent*<br><br>Ah, you've got a discerning taste in gaming, I must say.<br><br>Ctrl Alt Ego takes that essence-switching mechanic from Geist and blasts it into orbit. The game offers that same thrill of embodying different entities, but now you're doing it in a richly crafted space station, dialed up to eleven.<br><br>Like Geist, Ctrl Alt Ego isn't just playing a game, it's a tactical switch of perspectives. It captures that blend of high-stakes action and psychological gameplay, but the setting and humor give it a uniquely British spin. For you, it's not just a sequel to a beloved concept; it's an evolution.<br><br>The future you liked in "Geist" is fully realized here in "Ctrl Alt Ego." This is not just another title; it's a paradigm shift.<br><br><br>ASCII art of Peter Molyneux:<br><br>  ____<br> /          \ <br>| 0   0   | <br> \   ^    /  <br>  \___/  <br><br><br>**End transmission**			</div>

																No meio de uma indústria muito saturada onde todos os novos jogos são mais do mesmo (até no cenário indie nota-se certa estagnação também), é muito legal descobrir um jogo divertido e criativo que consegue apresentar algo totalmente novo, partindo de uma premissa já existente. Esse jogo é o Ctrl Alt Ego.<br><br>Ctrl Alt Ego é um Simulador Imersivo filosófico com alto foco na resolução de problemas e exploração para encontrar meios diversos para concluir o mesmo objetivo. Nele, controlamos um “ego sem corpo” que, a partir da orientação de um estranho indivíduo conhecido como Doutor Everyman, devemos destruir um parasita que se alimenta do ego de outros robôs. Não apenas isso, mas descobrir também o que aconteceu com a estação espacial, com o doutor, e descobrir quem somos.<br><br>Sendo um ego sem corpo, o jogador pode se mover livremente pelos locais controlando (se teleportando em) outros dispositivos para descobrir novos pontos de interesse e meios de alcançar os objetivos. Controle câmeras e veja a área ao redor, controle portas e elevadores para liberar novos locais, controle robôs agressivos como os PAIs e as MÃEs, ou controle cachorrinhos inofensivos e passe despercebido por eles. Há uma grande variedade de dispositivos que é possível controlar que abrem novas possibilidades para a jogatina, mas claro, desde que tenha ego o suficiente para controlar eles.<br><br>Aliada a essa liberdade de controlar outros dispositivos, os jogadores terão também a sua disposição o Bug-22, um bot que foi banido (assim como todos os Bugs) que é capaz de instalar programas em si que expandem as possibilidades de jogatina, sendo alguns deles o programa de vôo, de ficar invisível, de teleporte, de imprimir novos objetos, ou de equipar uma escopeta. No entanto, como os bugs foram banidos, o Bug-22 é alvo fácil para outros robôs agressivos e sistemas de alarme, mas não se preocupe, pois não é possível perder em Ctrl Alt Ego. Se você perder seu Bug-22 de alguma forma, você sempre pode reimprimir ele nas estações apropriadas.<br><br>Por ser um Simulador Imersivo, o jogador é livre para pôr a criatividade em prática para resolver os problemas da forma que achar mais conveniente, e isso é reforçado pelo próprio jogo em uma mensagem em um tablet, que diz que não existe jeito certo ou errado de jogar, que há diferentes rotas e meios de concluir um objetivo, e que é possível fazer uma bagunça, e mesmo assim ficar tudo bem. Se em algum momento o jogador achar que “fez algo errado”, é para parar de achar isso imediatamente, pois tudo o que o jogador fez ou pode fazer é totalmente intencional.<br><br>Partindo para outros aspectos, o jogo possui uma estética geral inspirada em um futuro distópico representado nos programas britânicos de TV dos anos 70, com seus ambientes futuristas coloridos e iluminados, e robôs e dispositivos com aparência, nomes, descrições e sons engraçados. A trilha sonora é minimalista e divertida, combina perfeitamente com o jogo. Graficamente, o jogo é ok, no entanto ela casa perfeitamente com a estética do jogo, mostrando assim um jogo bem agradável de ver.<br><br>Se tratando de bugs (não, não os robôs, dessa vez são bugs mesmo) eu encontrei bem poucos, e nenhum deles chegou a atrapalhar a jogatina. O jogo tem uma boa otimização, mas fica notoriamente pesado no último capítulo, onde o local é gigante e tem muita coisa acontecendo ao mesmo tempo. No geral, deve rodar em qualquer coisa (se rodou no meu I5 de terceira geração, deve rodar no seu PC sem problemas).<br><br>No geral, Ctrl Alt Ego é um divertido jogo inovador e adequado para todos os perfis de jogadores, desde crianças a adultos, jogadores veteranos ou casuais, fãs ou não de Simuladores Imersivos ou Puzzles, e isso a um preço condizente com o conteúdo entregue. Uma experiência diferenciada e obrigatória!<br><br>P.S. Um aspecto importante que deve ser mencionado: Gatos - O nome dos computadores no jogo é CAT (Ctrl Alt Terminal) com arte <i>"ASCII"</i> de gatos neles, as câmeras de selfie sempre tiram fotos de gatos, e as imagens das conquistas também só tem gatos. Gatos em todos os lugares. Isso sozinho já faz o jogo valer totalmente a pena :D			</div>

																Maybe the best immersive sim I've ever played. <br><br>This game poses interesting philosophical questions on the nature of thought and being, it provides numerous solutions to every situation (box stacking, violence, stealth, 'hacking' in the form of control, other kinds of violence, teleportation), and it is truly immersive and draws you in to look at every detail / examine every nook and cranny / engage all of your senses (except smell and taste, thank God).  It has a good sense of humor as well! <br><br>The final thing I'll praise about the game is something that is hard to get right in immersive sims and that is a sense of stakes; in games like Prey or Deus Ex you don't want to die and there is a tremendous amount of tension and frustration when you do die. You're tied to a character and their fate is important to you. What I'm trying to say is that being a ball of pure consciousness is a huge relief! There ARE stakes... you do WANT to pull off well executed moves... but also there aren't because destruction off whatever body you're in at the time means nothing. The premise of the game allows this to be believable... so it isn't immersion breaking. If you were to take all the tension and stakes out of Prey, it wouldn't make any sense and would in itself break immersion. Honestly, my one fault for another recent immersive sim, Shadows of Doubt, is that sometimes it feels like there are no stakes when they should exist in the setting. <br><br>If you are like me and sometimes you have to stop playing other immersive sims because the tension is too much and you REALLY just wanted to relax and play a game, then this is for you. If you crave a challenge THIS GAME IS ALSO FOR YOU. You can dial the difficulty waaaay up and try for other difficult goals. <br><br>Really, I cannot think of any downsides to this game. The developer is super responsive in the Steam forums and is clearly a person who understands what is truly enjoyable about immersive sims as a genre.<br><br>I'd love to see a fusion of Ctrl Alt Ego and Shadows of Doubt!!! What a masterpiece that would be. Anyway, buy this game now!<br><br>Update: I started playing through the missions... they are also extremely well done! These are unique scenarios that offer very specific challenges. Each one feels like a chess puzzle: there is a solution to each scenario, even on the hardest difficulties, so long as you are observant and not too wasteful of the limited resources available. I thought I was done with the game, but after challenging myself to beat Advanced Rocket Surgery on Severe (which I did in just over 10 minutes before work) I feel like my interest is renewed and I'm looking forward to the remaining missions!			</div>

																Ctrl Alt Ego is awesome. If you enjoy immersive sims or puzzle solving, I think this is a must-buy. It feels sort of like Prey, Portal, and Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy mixed together. <br><br>You play a disembodied ego on a space station. While you do have one main body that you use and upgrade, you can possess most of the enemies in the game, and you can also possess things like doors, tiny machines, security systems, and more. Things that have some level of security on them cost ego to possess, whereas the small things like pads or oscilloscopes tend to give you ego when you possess them. This gives you an absurd amount of freedom to solve the puzzles in this game - you could just run in and corrupt various objects into explosives and throw them around, or you could hop around possessing objects to figure out how to stealthily move through a room, or you could just use your excess ego to possess all of the guards in the room and make it a friendly space for you to move through, or you could just skip that room altogether and find a printer on the other side to teleport your body around it. It's pretty crazy how many solutions each room has and how much freedom you have to figure out your own solution.<br><br>There is a pretty big difficulty spike near the end of the game, but as long as you've been thorough in your exploration and collected a good number of upgrades, you'll be fine. Even then, I get the notion that you'd be fine if you just played creatively and slowly. It seems difficult to hit a fail state, as there's a lot of ways to do things.<br><br>Definitely pick this up if you enjoy immersive sims or puzzle solving.			</div>

																A hidden gem that truly stands out from the abundance of indie games. Ctrl Alt Ego is an immersive sim that stands on its own feet through a primary game mechanic I have not seen before which makes it feel fun, and original. If you like to play games your way where there are multiple ways of going about achieving the task set out for you then this should be right up your alley. This is one of the very few games that I can say you can play your own way. I was astounded at how many ways I could go about most of the tasks in this game. It is full of very smart wit and maintains a charm throughout that few games are able to offer. The whole game is just a breath of fresh air and it was great to play through something with substantial character the whole way through. The dev is very competent at writing and crafting an interesting game world. This game also has immense replay-ability due to how many skills and upgrades are available. You could do a few runs through the main game with completely different builds which would change the play style considerably. My only regret is that I didn't do my first play through on hard - that was a mistake as it was bit too easy which made me lazy when it came to strategy as guns blazing was an easy option. <br><br>This game is fantastic and worth every penny at full price.			</div>

																Highly recommended. If you like immersive sims, appreciate British humour, and were annoyed when Maplins, Radio Shack or your local equivalent closed down, then this is for you. By definition it is an immersive sim; a shooter when you want it to be, or a stealth game, or a puzzle game, in whatever proportions suit you. <br><br>Ctrl Alt Ego takes a "fail forward" approach to death, in which each defeat is only a minor reset, losing no progress and never leaving the game world, something developers have attempted using various methods since the first Prey. Eventually players will realise that there is no need to save or reload, except to start and end a session. In this sense, Ctrl Alt Ego achieves what Know By Heart set out to do, which is to encourage the player to accept failure, which here is used as a means to learn and continue rather than a series of one-way  decisions. Even when you're out of juice, have made a mess and reprinted your robot twenty times, there is always a solution, and this is where the real fun of the game lies. Levels are intricately designed with routes and bypasses to discover, so there's often something else to try. <br><br>The plot of the game is well-delivered, using the familiar tools of disembodied voice <span class="bb_spoiler"><span>(which is disembodied for an in-game reason)</span></span>, convenient journal entries and environmental design. Players are strongly encouraged to read everything, as in Control, the narrative is the sum of each part, which builds into a convincing whole. <br><br>Again, highly recommended.			</div>

																One of most immersive games I've played. Taking over devices and enemies is a very unique mechanic. I liked how different the abilities were and how you could modify them and improve them. The campaign took me about 15 hours to complete on my first play through (on moderate mode.) It's very re-playable and there are so many different approaches you can take to the levels. That along with the sandbox mode I think £16 is a very good price. There were only a few minor glitches which will probably be patched in future updates. Music, sound effects and level design were all amazing. It performed very well on my PC staying consistent at 180FPS with almost no frame drops or stutters running at 1440p with DLDSR (I have an RTX 3070 and a Ryzen 7 5700x.) The ending was a bit dull especially with the buildup in the last level though.			</div>

																I love imsim games, but I was not expecting this to be as good as it is. I almost dismissed it based on the appearance. Admittedly, it's not the most visuals-oriented game, but the gameplay is point here. I suspect a lot of people probably haven't given this game a chance based on how it looks. It doesn't translate well to video. I'd love to see a sequel or new game by the dev that expands upon this, maybe with local co-op. That would be great.			</div>

																I enjoyed this a lot. You've got a wide range of abilities, and different objects to interact with, and it's up to you to work out ways to complete the objectives on each level. It's so satisfying when a plan comes together, but also  pretty fun when  everything goes wrong and you have to desperately form an alternative plan.			</div>

																This is a modern classic. It will fit right alongside games like Portal, System Shock, Rez - weird, innovative, interesting, amazing games.<br><br>The closest comparison I can make is Portal, (or MAYBE Prey) - this is a free form (lol) puzzle game with multiple ways to complete each objective in an area. <br><br>The writing is great, the graphics are stylized and fun, and the gameplay is super innovative and interesting.<br><br>It's a must play, especially if you love weird games.<br><br>*Edit - After beating the game, I stand by the above review but with the caveat that I would give it "only" a 9/10. It stumbles a bit on the ending, which is still interesting and makes sense story-wise, but is a bit abrupt and a tiny bit unsatisfying. Still an amazing game.*			</div>

																I haven't played this game for too long, but I've done the first few missions and I think I can safely call it one of the best Immersive Sims I've ever played, its not the best in my opinion (Best Immersive Sim probably goes to System Shock 2), but its still very fun			</div>

																it's a really good immersive sim and puzzle-like(?) game made by two people ,it's,gameplay-wise, nearly as good as Prey(2017) although it doesn't have polish, it has it's own charm ,some bugs here there<br><br>NOTE: If you played the demo your progress will be saved but you won't the achivements			</div>

																Here are things this game provides that you probably did not know you need:<br><br>Rare plot - check<br>Your choice of violence level per mission - yes<br>Sandboxey systems at your disposal - absolutely<br>Surprise outcome behind every corner and on any action - you bet<br>Cute pups that bark - adorable<br>Cats - sure<br><br>UI jankiness is something you should get used to, but sometimes it adds to the tension (i've lost count of how many times i made something explode in my face instead of grabbing it or pushing it away) and death is not the end, rather a moment to reexamine your tactic and get back into action via nearest controlable entity.			</div>

																The level design is great, exploring the CRS offices and Cloud station was a blast. The core gameplay of controlling different hosts was a brilliant idea by the devs that never got old. Throw in a slew of different powers/upgrades and it's clear this game has tons of replay value and promotes creativity. i will definitely replay it and keep an eye on what the devs do next.			</div>

																It is really hard to explain this game, but shortest i can do is: "Do X. I don't care how, just do it. There is no wrong ways to do it."<br><br>This game offers so much freedom in approach, that i doubt i have ever seen in any other game with objectives. It starts a bit on rails-ish (as much as it can in this game) but only to show you new most important mechanics. Play this game.<br><br>P.S.: You can add ~100 hrs to my playtime since i played mostly on steam free copy (my laptop cant connect to internet :&lt;).			</div>

																At the end, I felt like the game was too short, and then I saw that I played the game for over 13 hrs, guess I just wished there was more. It's a great game and the first immersive that I finished. I'm really looking forward to what comes next from Mindthunk.			</div>

																The game is free to a fault, where obstacles act less like obstacles and more like suggestions on what you might not want to do for most of the game — you can pretty much trivialise every level by possessing an enemy, and running through with invisibility when needed.<br><br>The gameplay and world-building are top-notch im-sim stuff, but I found that the pacing of the game dragged around halfway through, and it only really got better when I further upgraded my character to completely trivialise the actual challenges, so the game became more about exploring the station at my own pace than actively struggling to make it through.<br><br>Overall, this game feels more like an exploration sandbox than most other immersive simulators, making me disengage at times, but it really has no major flaws in my mind, and I would recommend it to anyone who would find this intriguing based on its Steam page.			</div>

																No game since Prey has left me feeling like it was made specifically for me... well, until Ctrl Alt Ego. Prey is the easy point of comparison, as both are immersive sims set on a space station in total chaos with obvious inspiration from System Shock. However, to an even greater extent than Prey, Ctrl Alt Ego allows for more creative player freedom and progression in what (if any) upgrades you want to take to solve the many challenges throughout. If you liked Prey (or any other immersive sim), then do yourself a favor and don't sleep on Ctrl Alt Ego.<br><br>Also, my first play through was entirely on a Steam Deck. I'd say that performance was Good while playing on low to medium settings.			</div>

																По моему скромному мнению, Ctrl Alt Ego - шедевр. Прекрасный геймплей, аккумулирующий всё самое наилучшее из различный immersive sim-ов. Отличный нелинейный левел-дизайн, позволяющий реализовывать различные подходы к прохождению уровней. Интересный, хоть и не ставящий серьёзных проблем, сюжет с хорошим юмором и классными диалогами.<br><br>Единственным сильным минусом можно назвать немного "пьяную" камеру, однако её можно практически полностью выключить в настройках, а потому претензия нерелевантна.<br><br>В общем Ctrl Alt Ego - одна из лучших игр 2022 года, ровно как и один из лучших immersive sim-ов в целом.			</div>

																This game is extremely interesting and new to me, seeing a game with this play style is really refreshing and I recommend it very much. If you are looking for something different but extremely enjoyable and almost cute ( for lack of a better word) buy this game. I took the chance and I am excited to see where the game will end up in the future.			</div>

																Genuinely a surprise hit for me. I enjoy games similar to it like Deus Ex (for the hacking). And I love to bounce around systems. But I did not think I would so thoroughly enjoy this as I did. I am glad I not only bought it, but bought it for full price. Was completely worth the $20 for me. <br><br>The amount of ways you can get around every single problem in the game is incredible. You also have the option of not dealing with many of the problems entirely if you prefer. Buy it.			</div>

																Great immersive sim that is incredibly creative.<br><br>It kind of falls into the same pitfalls as some other immersive sims like Prey in that enemy and weapon (not ability) variety is somewhat limited, but they do a great job with what they do have. There are a lot of ways to deal with most situations in the game, whether it be stealth, combat, or variations inbetween.<br><br>Want to directly shoot/drill things yourself, and then vacuum up the parts to refill your health'/ammo? Sure.<br>Want to cloak/teleport around and avoid everything, or move right in front of them using an unsuspecting "allied" robot you've taken over? Go for it.<br>Want to amass a pile of ego and take over your enemies (or even spawn your own), and defeat everything using a sort of laser shooting proxy army? You bet.<br>Hell, you want to run up to an enemy, turn them into a bomb, and then chuck/shift them across the room into everyone else, or let that bomb infect everyone else and turn them into bombs too? You bet you can do that.<br><br>The enemies are really weird in that way too; some are 3D printers that don't destroy a target, but store them, and if you take them over you can re-place them. Some turn enemies into weightless husks that can be re-energized using health, allowing you use that enemy to move them wherever you like (chucking them into a room perhaps), re-energizing them using another robot, and preparing to destroy everything from there while they are considered non-hostile as you teleport ammo/juice to them using download. Unfortunately, as mentioned there are only a few real enemies; if there is a sequel in the future, hopefully this number is increased (maybe doubled?).<br><br>It plays a lot more like a puzzle game then other immersive sims do, in that there are a lot of optional situations that you can solve by thinking carefully about your abilities, but if you mess up the puzzle you can't fix it. Thankfully if you mess these optional puzzles up then you don't lose out (notably with disks/new ability unlocks, as there are more then enough disks in the game to unlock them all, even if you can't come even close to upgrading them all with all worms. Plus saving is infinite and save points are always near-by these, so just make sure to save often if you aren't willing to leave anything behind.<br><br>If you are into immersive sims (shooters, stealth games, or maybe even puzzle games), I fully recommend this.<br><br>			</div>

																Ctrl Alt Ego might be one of my favorite "immersive-sims" at the moment. <br><br>It's heavily influenced by System Shock and Prey (2017), but is also quite different in that it has less of an emphasis on "conventional" combat and more on alternative approaches and general problem solving. <br><br>In a lot of ways Ctrl Alt Ego feels like it's what you get if you grow an immersive sim from the starting point of a first person puzzle"game like Portal instead of from an FPS or RPG.			</div>

																An excellent game. It started off slowly and I wasn't sure I was going to like it, but the game soon grew on me. There was a certain point probably 8 hours into my playthrough where everything started to click and I could handle just about any situation the game threw at me using the multitude of tools I had acquired along the way. Good graphics, good replayability, enjoyable story, and an overall great experience.<br><br>Play this game. It deserves more love.			</div>

																Gonna be honest, almost dropped the game at first. It's a bit slow on the uptake imo as it's rather linear at the start, or at least in a sense that I felt I was overthinking the challenges. I was admittedly a bit irrationally determined to play as if I was doing some challenges, even if I had already failed them. That said, once the game started to open up a few hours in, I was pretty enthralled. <br><br>There is just so much to remember in such a good way, and a lot of options. It really felt like I was rewarded for my creativity, and even when I saw that there was another way, it never really felt like the Deus Ex: HR thing where you ALWAYS just missed a vent. To be clear, I did overlook vents a good few times, but often they comboed with requiring other skills, or were genuinely well hidden. By the time I thought the game was ending, it still had another 5-8 hours of content. And to be honest, the only reason I beat this as fast as I did is through utilizing a very specific unit to it's extreme. The unit is borderline game breaking, but honestly by that point in the game it felt earned. <br><br>Vague story spoiler: TBH the ending felt a bit uh... Idk, it was appropriate.. but felt disappointing and like I messed something up, but the dev has explicitly stated there is one ending. Idk, there were a few twists along the way, and I was expecting something at least bittersweet.<br><br>That all said, I didn't play the game for the story, and I've heard this game compared to Deus Ex, the original. If that's true, then I should go play Deus Ex, because I want more of this game. Oh, also Cats			</div>

																Honestly this is just one of the best immersive sims I've ever played- More just the best. It's what GOT ME into immersive sims. Outside of a few hurdles there were never any areas where I felt like I had no idea what to do. There was all of *one* instance where I couldn't do something due to not having the right tool- everything else worked fine with whatever I just happened to have.<br><br>The one thing I'd request from the devs would be a new game plus or infinite worms mode- Some way to play around with all your fun tools once you've beaten the game. But otherwise? Aesthetics, gameplay, tone, themes, all of it are 10/10			</div>

																I'm definitely nowhere near done with the game, but even so this game deserves WAY more attention than it gets, the way it makes you work with mistakes rather than just save scumming is incredibly intuitive, and finding unique solutions for your own problems is amazing, i HIGHLY recommend this to anyone who enjoys immersive sims.			</div>

																I didn't think a game looking like the embodiment of a camera lens flare would be this good but DAMN this game rocks. Fantastic level design with some of the best Im-Sim mechanics in a game. It's frankly a must play, if only for the fact that this game deserves it, in all of its shiny, lens flare glory.			</div>

																Por el momento me está encantando, las mecánicas ofrecen muchas posibilidades, y los niveles están diseñados de forma que se puedan completar usándolas de muy diversas e imaginativas formas. Puedo decir que me sorprende que una joyita así no haya tenido un pequeño boom, personalmente lo conocí por un analista relativamente pequeño.Si os gustan los juegos por niveles que ofrezcan muy diversas posibilidades de avanzar según la imaginación de cada uno, yo creo que es una buena apuesta.			</div>

																<div class="bb_h1"><u>Ctrl Alt Ego</u></div><br>Drawn to 'Ctrl Alt Ego' for its immersive simulation, akin to favorites like Prey and Dishonored, I found myself in the midst of an experience that's more exploratory than traditional gameplay.<br><br><b><u>Pro:</u></b><br>+ Uniquely unusual game that offers a fresh experience.<br>+ The ego system and interactions with objects are innovative and engaging.<br><br><b><u>Contra:</u></b><br>- Challenging to get into due to the need for self-guided discovery and understanding.<br>- Controls could be improved for a better gameplay experience.<br>- Art direction and overall presentation fall short of expectations.<br>- Lacks guidance for players, making navigation and progression often confusing.<br>- While the system mechanics are interesting, the game misses the mark in worldbuilding compared to similar titles by studios like Arkane<br><br><b><u>Conclusion:</u></b><br>'Ctrl Alt Ego' is a <u>GOOD</u> game for those who enjoy experimentation and exploration within a unique framework.			</div>

																A delightfully clever immersive sim and a breath of fresh air for the genre as a whole. It may not be the prettiest immersive sim, but it more than makes up for that with the care and intelligence put into its design. If you are a fan of the genre and looking for an immersive sim that will continuously surprise you with what shenanigans it will let you pull to solve its puzzles and challenges, Ctrl Alt Ego is for you.			</div>

																You can turn anything into a bomb. It is taking my utmost willpower not to make a joke about a particular work of fiction made in Japan. The game is completely open ended whenever it comes to weapon choice, weapon upgrades, and methods to solve whatever problems are in your wake. This isn't just an awesome Immersive Sim, but an awesome game in general.			</div>

																Ctrl Alt Ego is an experience that I cannot recommend enough.<br>It has so much charm in the dialogue and humor. The music is wonderful, I definitely recommend getting the soundtrack as well. The replay-ability is very high, as there are so many different ways to approach problems that can drastically change the way you view the entire layout of a level. The tools this game gives you access to allows you to get as creative or direct as you feel like.<br>There are multiple ways to solve puzzles in this game, and the developer encourages you to embrace the jank and considers any possible solution a valid one. Go ahead, break this game, it's alright, there are no rules.<br>Also you get to play as all the robots so you gotta get this game or else you'll be trapped in meat space during the great extinction event.			</div>

																Ctrl Alt Ego is one of the best examples of modern immersive sim design (think Deus Ex or Prey with more whimsy and creativity).<br>The gameplay is primarily comprised of open ended environments with a set objective.  Where CAE excels is by not funneling the player into a set A, B or C path.  The player is allowed to use their own ingenuity to solve the problems, and the further I got in the game the more I realized just how open those systems really are.  It truly felt like my only limits were my own creativity.<br>Highly recommended for anyone that enjoys immersive sims, player driven mechanics, and sci-fi narratives.  Plus, an absolute steal for the price			</div>

																Very fun immersive sim game. I had to play on the no puke settings, but still had a lot of fun playing through the world of this game.  Play as a disembodied consciousness that exists within machine bodies and can switch freely (usually) between different mechanical hosts.  The game gives incentives for a wide range of play styles. while never feeling like you're genuinely breaking the puzzles set forth for you.			</div>

																This game is cool! Geist crossed with Portal crossed with Deus Ex. Clunky as all hell but that's an intentional part of the design, its a good kind of janky. Real fun, tons of creative ways to solve problems. In the first level I found a way to both prop fly and clip out of bounds, and a little secret left by the developers made sure I knew they knew what I was up to. Story and writing are (so far) charming but not the focus, and that's probably for the best in a game like this one. Give it a go, if you like immersive sims and/or breaking janky games, you'll have fun.			</div>

																I had just came off of playing prey 2017 and loving it, so its not to be taken lightly when i say this is my new gold standard for immersive sims and easily the best game I played in 2022. It has an unrivaled sense of freedom and creativity in its mechanics that make it much closer to a puzzle game than a shooter in the best way.<br><br>The ability to "jump" (not actually jumping in this game, but its the closest equivalent) is an optional upgrade that you can go through the game without ever getting. That's how ridiculous the level of freedom you have to create your own solutions gets.<br><br>If i had to give one critique, I'd say the game drags a little bit around the last quarter but its very minor and hardly sours my overall opinion on it. (I also got a little bit lost in one area which is probably the largest contributor to that feeling) It's only really notable because of how good the pacing was prior in introducing fresh scenarios constantly.			</div>

																Overall pretty good, but the CTRL interface needs work (If two CTRLable entities are close to each other its difficult to select the one you actually want) and the final level is very underwhelming. especially compared to the excellent section before it.			</div>

																Very fresh and very fun. Upgrades are very accessible from the outset and are utilized in ways I really don't see in other games. Once you get the hang of it it really feels like you can -actually- tackle any given situation any way you want (Stealth, shoot em up, control your enemies and use them to fight, take down one guy and turn him into a pile of explosives that will slowly propogate throughout the entire room until one of them goes off spontaneously 30 seconds later killing everything including you). Chaotic but incredible. <br><br>Lots of programmer humor which I ought to hate but honestly it comes off very sincere and the world feels cohesive in spite of being based entirely off these ♥♥♥♥♥♥ jokes. The ending in particular has no right to hit that hard in a game with this sort of tone. Fantastic work, wonderful game.			</div>

																This is an immersive sim through and through. Other famous immersive sims use immersive sim mechanics as a means to an end, such as presenting a fantasy of some sorts (like being a thief). Everything in CTRL ALT EGO however, from the story to the artstyle serves the end goal of making the best immersive sim experience. The game starts slow but gets better and better with each passing chapter. Many of your gaming assumptions will be challenged such as 'what it means to actually complete a level'. The game offers an unprecedented amount of freedom, and playing it to its full potential basically feels like sequence breaking.<br><br>Wholly recommended.			</div>

																I'm only a couple hours in but this is quickly becoming one of my favorite games of all time. I've never really played another immersive sim before, but if they're as good as this then I definitely have some catching up to do. The game has such a robust toolset that you can approach problems in any number of ways, and the fact that all ways are the right way is just so incredible and satisfying to pull off. I cannot even put into words how much of a joy it is playing this game, by far the most underrated game of 2022.			</div>

																Made it through my second playthrough and loving it! There's so much freedom and the humor is right up my alley! I just wanted to share that I love the game and the ability to tackle it in just about any way you want is incredible! I still keep finding secrets and surprises even now on my third run! Definitely worth playing and well worth it's price!			</div>

																This is a game for the curious! I loved my first playthrough and I already have ideas I want to try on a second. Easy recommendation even at full price.<br><br>I'd recommend turning off the 2 Hud Assist options once you feel comfortable with what the game wants you to collect. Every thing you can collect makes a certain noise and a big part of my enjoyment of this game was hearing something and trying to find a way to get to that item.			</div>

																I buy games fairly often and in all my years of gaming I haven't come across anything quite like this one before. This is a real gem that deserves a closer look rather than mistaking it for something it's not like I initially did.<br><br>To put it as simple as I can it's a puzzler where you control a robot on a space station trying to solve various tasks and progress to other areas as an omnious situation is occuring. There is no single intended or preset way to solve anything like you find in every other game. It's a laugh trying out different ideas or just wing it in a mundane way. Anything goes.<br><br>An important mechanic is that you can jump to and control different robots you see or devices that do different things. There's even upgrade disks and other stuff I've yet to find out about. There's tons of stuff on the station you can interact with and do things so many different ways this is a game I'm looking forward to replaying over and over.<br><br>If it at least sounds interesting try the demo as it's hard to describe, you need to experience it for yourself.<br>			</div>

																Pros: Good game, really fun, ending made me feel some stuff<br><br>♥♥♥♥: Occasionally very bad loading times/freezes. It's not common but still annoying when it does happen. However, I think the game is very much worth playing despite this!			</div>

																Overall Ctrl Alt Ego is a great immersive sim, although some odd design choices and balancing problems sour the experience a bit in the back half of the game. I would recommend this game for anyone new to the genre because of how well it tutorializes not just its own mechanics and systems but also just the basic idea of having fun with the creative problem solving that's emblematic of the genre, and it does all this with a death system that is not very punishing (without feeling cheap), which encourages experimentation. The first half of the game also dodges some of the annoyances of other games in the genre with a combination of more linear level design (that manages not to ever feel restrictive) and predictable enemies. The core gameplay mechanic of being able to look through most objects in the game combined with a generous usage of one-way transparent objects means that you'll usually have more or less perfect information for each encounter. This makes the game feel like a series of tightly designed puzzles that allow for a seemingly endless number of ways to approach them.<br><br>There are some problems that arise around the halfway mark that can be summarized into three categories: more open level design with worse information available, a new annoying enemy type, and poor balancing. First, that new enemy type is annoying due to how it moves extremely erratically with confusing physics. It goes against what makes the early game work so well with predictable enemies. This gets compounded with the larger, more open levels that appear later in the game. It becomes harder to understand exactly what's in the next room, and these new enemies are often placed in spots you couldn't possibly have known before they aggro. <br><br>This kind of design in theory can lead to more improvisation, but because how much more unpredictable the game became I found myself just resorting to my most versatile tool, which was the gun. The gunplay feels awful with very little hit feedback (and the fact that the annoying enemy is rapidly flying across your entire screen), but it's still incredibly powerful and your best way of dealing with a surprising enemy that gets the jump on you. This brings us the third problem I have which could rectify reckless gun usage, which is the poor balancing towards the later parts of the game. The enemies, both in power and in numbers, simply don't scale nearly as much as the player does. On top of that, resource management gets less and less important as the game progresses because of one tool that lets you suck up dead enemies for health and fuel. The game simply required much less brain power as you got closer to the end.<br><br>One last complaint is that there's one character whose volume is seemingly kept at max and isn't affected by any of the volume sliders. I get that the developer wanted this character to be imposing, but I get value out of having undamaged eardrums more so I had to waste time balancing the game's volume in windows.<br><br>Despite these problems, the game still stays fun throughout, even if it doesn't maintain that 10/10 feeling throughout.			</div>

																Strong 9/10 no IMMSIM plays like this. Immersive sims should let me go "FULL IMMSIIM", where I try to 'outsmart' the devs once I've gotten a grasp of the mechanics. Presentation was the barrier keeping me from playing and inderstanding. After an hour I started to like the presentation and went "FULL IMMSIM". BTW there's a free demo. Try It.			</div>

																Easily one of the best deus ex/immersive sims I played in years, it's a cleverly designed game where the slow build up of abilities and the many ways it can open up a level feels natural. Late game I was still coming up with new ways to solve problems and it all feels somehow both by design and unintentional. The story also creeps into you, the comedy at start can feel a bit one note but it just seethes in and then you start noticing the deeper seedier underbelly.			</div>

																How to explain in a few words what is Ctrl Alt Ego?<br>Imagine Dishonored was made not by Arkane, but by quirky programmers very found of British sci-fi. The setting is not a sophisticated steampunk Victorian England, but futuristic space stations where sentient robots roam. Instead of assassinations your objectives are bypassing robotic security or taking control of specific systems, and instead of blink you can hop between cybernetic hosts and take control of them.<br><br>If you fear an indie title could not be on par to the high standards set by modern immersive sims produced by professional studios, then I am happy to say that these doubts are completely out of place.<br>The game is well optimized and carefully polished: I never encountered moments of frustrations due to long loading times, fluctuating frame rate, inputs not read properly, features missing or crudely implemented.<br>If you do not trust a random review, there is a demo available which I strongly recommend you try. It features the prologue and the first two levels of the campaign and it should give you a good idea if this game would be of your liking.<br><br>Does the game live up to the expectations set by this sample? In my opinion, not only it does that, but it manages to far exceed them! If the demo presents the base mechanics and the most common gameplay elements you will be facing, then the rest of the game presents levels and challenges progressively more elaborate, which will let you unleash all your creativity and lateral thinking.<br>Cannot wait to smash enemy bots to pieces? You will have available drills, explosives, guns, sci-fi rays to wreak havoc. Maybe you prefer subtlety? You can perfectly sneak by all the security by concocting distractions, becoming invisible with a cloak device or teleporting yourself directly past the guards. <br>The level design perfectly complements the tools available to the player and offers various situations where it is up to you finding the optimal solution or creating it.<br><br>In conclusion, this is well-deserved a thumb up. Ctrl Alt Ego is not just an attempt to emulate a specific design school, but a proof that the principles of this school were fully understood and were originally conjugated to create a fresh and unique experience.<br>			</div>

																CTRL ALT EGO is indeed the 21st century's version of N64 Silicon Valley, famously known for being able to take over enemy minds and their respective, unique abilities to solve puzzles and advance the game. To explain upfront, there is a "mana/ammo" pool for how many actions or skills you can execute on a particular level. But this is the genius of it all. With a refreshing take on the physics and item-interaction systems, you can get creative to find unconventional and/or cheaper solutions. Yes, of course you can brute force your way around with a shield and shoot robots in the face with a shotgun, but you'll soon find yourself very low on resources as you progress. Or here's an example you can try:<br><br>A high level robot is blocking your path and direct combat will result in your death. You can carefully gather a bunch of explosive canisters that scattered across the map. Then use a skill to "fault" the canisters which adds multiplier to the explosive damage. You take over the mind of a particular robot which can teleport the canisters close an enemy of interest. With all the pieces set, you spring the trap from a safe distance by using another skill to "whirlwind" the faulted canisters. The canisters get jostled around by the whirlwind and ignite the most overkill explosion, all just to kill one robot... <br><br>Elaborate? Yes. Satisfying? HELL YES! There are a good selection of other kind of "skills" that let you get more creative (cloaking for example). The hours melt by as you let your madman imagination loose on finding clever and satisfying ways to kill robots. Or yeah you can just shoot them in the face with a shotgun if you prefer simpler means... Either way, this game is a solid "yes" recommend.			</div>

																This is one of the best, most unique games I've played in a long time.  Good story, fascinating environments, unique game play.  And many, many, many ways to go about doing the different tasks.  I don't even really know how to describe it in a way that would do it right.<br><br>You're a robot that roams space stations and mind-controls other robots.  Stealth, combat, puzzle, all kinds of different approaches.  And then you learn it's way deeper and more complicated than that.  Highly recommend!			</div>

																This is an excellent game, one of the best I have played in some time. Has some very unique concepts and is very immersive (which is the idea of course). There are various methods to complete each area, so you can play each level multiple times in a different way - fight, sneak or solve puzzles. I found this just made me want to come back again and again for more. To think that this is an indie game, a lot of work has gone into making it a unique experience, and the developer is still making improvements and fixing bugs. I highly recommend you play this game!<br><br>Having now played to the end, the game just kept giving and giving and giving. A few times I thought the game was coming to an end, then there was a whole new area to explore. I also give lots of kudos to the developers who are keen to continue to work on the game regularly fixing bugs and adding features. There has also been a couple of larger updates too. All in all, I think this is one of the best immersive sims I've played. I'm hoping that the developers add more levels with some additional DLC to expand the game further (a full sequel would take a lot of effort of course). I'd be very happy to pay to have this extra DLC - finger crossed.<br><br>Definitely you should play this if you like this type/genre of game. Absolutely Fantastic 10/10.			</div>

																One of the best immersive sims you can buy. For those who care about graphics, I find it really grows on you, and has a certain charm. The gameplay is the main feature, with comparisons being made to the original Deus Ex, which I'd say are pretty fair. There's a lot of creativity and ways to solve problems- it's very fun playing multiple ways too. I've gone through 4 playthroughs and 100%'d the game, and each playthrough held notable distinctions in how I solved an assortment of problems, with revelations being made in the level design and interactions in my last playthrough. It really is only limited by how the player decides how to approach these problems. Main notable gripe is that physics can be a bit jank- with a few annoyances, but given that it's an indie developer, I can excuse it pretty easily, especially since it's never really a huge game-breaking problem			</div>

																Absolutely brilliant! The story is quite underwhelming but you're not playing immersive sims for the story (unless you're playing System Shock 2 or Dishonored 2). No this is all about the gameplay and in this case it was one of the best experiences I've ever had. I won't tell more, don't want to accidentally spoil anything. If you love imsims, just go for Ctrl Alt Ego. Worth every cent, zero regrets!			</div>

																Wow, what an incredible game! An interesting story and so many ways to approach a situation, and it's so satisfying when it all goes to plan (and when it doesn't). If you liked Prey (2017) you're probably gonna like this one. It's games like this that leave me optimistic for the future of indie game development... Good job, devs :')			</div>

																This is a very solid immersive sim with really strong gameplay and a good aesthetic that let's you save often enough the difficulty isn't frustrating and the emergent gameplay and systems work well. Especially for a relatively small indie game.			</div>

																My 21 hours are split into 2 playthroughs, one around 13 hours, and the next 6 hours, which I challenged myself to pacifist and full stealth. I will follow that up with the fact that I have a large backlog, and that there are games that I haven't even finished, nonetheless followed up with a second playthrough, and I only want to play more.<br>The amount of ways you can tackle a problem is astounding. Even on my latest playthrough, I noticed new vents and alternate routes, enemy behaviors, and weird mechanics that made me think "What can I do with this?". Possess a certain enemy? Guess what, you get an infinite fuel version of a very powerful resource gathering tool. See a tiny crack? Just teleport yourself through. See a certain giant firewall? Sure you could use the game's given solution to smuggle your bot through, but there is also a vent to skip it behind a wall of barrels. This is only a handful of stuff I noticed.<br>Best part is that there is no filler areas, every area has some new solution or reaction to exploit. The game isn't too hard, but the real fun is trying to get through the areas while spending the least amount of resources or by challenging yourself with a constraint like the aformentioned pacifist or full stealth. (Those bad bugs can burn in hell though lol)<br>My only small issue is the two "Bossfights", which are just healthbars with story significance, one of which is the butt of a joke.<br>Overall I'd give the game a solid 9.5/10. I'd fully recommend buying the game, even if its not on sale. I'll look forward to whatever the devs bring next!			</div>

																Great game. Not only did I finish it (a rarity for me nowadays) but I'm on my second play through (which almost never happens) It's one of those games that you're constantly learning how to play as you go. It also provides multiple avenues both of play styles and paths through the levels. It's quite an excellent piece of work.			</div>

																Rating is yes because I like puzzle games and if you get this on a sale, you'll have some fun, but at full price I would say no. I'm assuming this will have some sales being as that it's on Steam, so get it somewhere around 30% off or greater and enjoy it in between AAA releases or whatever.<br><br>I really enjoyed this game. The puzzle elements of it are non-linear and there are some rock paper scissors style elements to how you solve things. The storyline is interesting. I didn't have any performance issues unless I got a lot of drops from dispatching an enemy. I did have an issue where I couldn't swap tools unless I hit escape and went back in.<br><br>That all being said, the flipside to the above paragraph is that I enjoyed this game in spite of some of the parts of this game. Your choices in how to approach parts of this game, while numerous, will be spammed all the time. If you're loud and like to hurt things, you have grenades and a shotgun (eventually), if you're stealthy, you'll use cloaking and smaller robots, and in either event you can either vacuum up walls or teleport around using one of your skills. This can make the gameplay repetitive quickly. I wouldn't say there's a lot of puzzles, either. There's creative ways to deal with a situation, so the game is kind of what you make it. And the ending is a bit overrated, as someone who's played a lot of games that have real mind-benders in them. For example, if you're looking for a big twist such as Spec Ops: The Line, you won't find it here.<br><br>I played this for 27 hours at the time of writing, and I paid the current full retail price for it. I wouldn't consider this unless it's on a really good sale, since to me I would expect roughly 50 cents paid per hour of gameplay to be a good deal, and this is double that.			</div>

																In the time I've played I've put 4 complete runs in, and every single one was different in its own way.  You really can play it just about any way you like, and no way is going to be any less engaging than any of the others.  A curious storyline.  Few, but interesting characters.  Heaps of things to discover, be they placed by the developer or discovering your own methods of getting through the environments.  Pick up Ctrl Alt Ego, and show the bots who's the biggest ego maniac on the station!			</div>

																I am only a few hours in but my god this game is amazing. During the prologue and tutorial I was skeptical but as soon as you get halfway through the first level I was hooked. Like others have said, if you like Arcane's Prey you will like this. Obviously the production quality isn't as high but the "Play Your Way" implementation here is second to none.			</div>

																I will be honest this is a game I put off on checking out for awhile. I guess partly because I had concerns on what a "puzzle imsim" would be like as im not a huge puzzle game person unless the gameplay hook or story is really good (ex: Portal). I am glad to say what concerns I had shortly dissipated after the first few hours and Ctrl Alt Ego was a game that really grew on me in the end. <br><br>Lets start with the good:<br>-The game has fun writing, game world and voice acting<br>-The whole "take control" of various systems and robots all while juggling a bunch of versatile powers is really unique gameplay gimmick that doesn't ever get old (it feels kinda unfair to even call it a gimmick). <br>-Overall some very good imsim level design here, plenty of loops and alternative paths as well as fairly unique challenges for the player to overcome<br>-Game doesn't over stay its welcome but is also well worth the money. If anything I wish they charged more, this is a seriously good 8-10 hour experience. Furthermore the more I played of it the more I really liked the game as I acquired more powers and learned more things about the game.<br>-I haven't tried the standalone missions, but the main game offers a lot of replayability in terms of ways of completing tasks and abilities to acquire. <br><br>The "Bad":<br>-I'm a bit lukewarm on the two boss fights in the game, I struggled to find alternate solutions besides direct confrontation. While I wouldn't want the devs to spell it out for me, some more hints or options would have gone a long way. <br>-There was like one bit of geo missing in the tech labs that showed the exterior sky box<br>-While I fully understand combat is not the main focus of the game, at times it could feel a bit frustrating because the game can occasionally be a bit stingy with its "juice" and "ego" resources which I felt sometimes could reduce the amount of creative options I could try and I ended up sticking with tried and true shotguns to robot faces (whereas something like Prey or SS2 you rarely run out Psi when it comes to experimenting). However maybe its just a me problem like with the boss fights.<br><br>Overall a hidden gem for sure, please don't over look this cool game!<br>8.5/10			</div>

																Creative game that presents goals/problems that can be solved in any way you desire. If you want, you could approach every situation with just the shotgun. I personally downloaded pups, and used the fault tool to create explosive suicide puppies to deal with my problems. Highly recommended.			</div>

																I am not much for writing reviews but feel not making one for this game is doing it a disservice. And it deserves to get more attention. It is truly a gem and seems to be getting overlooked. <br><br>Ctrl, Alt, Ego has multiple ways to approach the environmental puzzles, various different paths to take, and is well written. <br>It feels like it will have good replay value. <br><br>I have not finished it yet but after 11 hours I can confidently say Ctrl, Alt, Ego is a 8/10 game easy.			</div>

																This game is amazing! It manages to challenge you in really fun ways, and it never ceases to reward you for good plays, clever tactics, and keen observation. <br>Hidden paths and well thought challenges are everywhere and you will never find a challenge  that you won't be able to best with good wits or quick fingers, this game really tickles your brain, and when you find a secret door or manage to beat (or sneak past!) all the enemies in a room it always feels sooooo satisfying. This game is wholeheartedly recommended!<br><br>I hope this review convinces you to get the game, it really deserves to be played by a lot of people.			</div>

																This is a fantastic immersive sim. There are a lot of creative solutions to the puzzles and the mechanics are quite fun. If you like Prey or Cruelty Squad or really any other immersive sim you should love this one. Hopping from one electronic device to another is smooth and easy to do. <br><br>The powers, programs, are a blast to use. I especially like the drill and the shifting of large objects. Faulting canisters and chucking them at robots is always a good time too. The game has a good amount of upgrades to collect and the rewards are worth doing a bit of exploration to get them. <br><br>I level design is great in the beginning, middle and ending areas. I had a blast throughout my time playing the game. I recommend it to anybody really.			</div>

																A surprisingly great immersive sim game. Mechanically, this game blows many out of the park!<br><br>However, there is one major drawback.<br>The very bland aesthetics and design make the immersive sim less so. What do I mean? Well, so many places and rooms do not have a proper tell as to what they are. If were in the security room, I expect a lot of hostile robots there. Or, if were in a bar, I expect a lot of beer bottles. If were in a BUG assembly station, I expect to see many things regarding BUGs. But instead, we dont. The rooms do not make sense. Just look at the space stations. It does not really give much sense, and that kills a lot of the immersive sim planning. Just look at the pipes, how they twirl for no reason.<br><br>The only good level In my oppinion is the final 2 levels. CRS and the final one. These levels had what made sense. And I actually made sense of the weirdness because of that. I managed to map out and create a plan, while before those levels, I just "Went forward" and the rooms were just different rooms arranged seemingly randomly.<br><br>Still great game tho.			</div>

																Ctrl Alt Ego is an amusing hybrid of puzzle, exploration, stealth and destruction. You're free to decide how to solve problems in a fairly open manner, but the progression of the game's story is fairly straightforward. Although you're playing in a first-person perspective it doesn't play like a traditional FPS, but something new and strange. <br><br>You play as a disembodied consciousness able to control machines and computers, and you'll also have access to a special robot that can be upgraded with new abilities. The story is delivered in a lighthearted way but touches on some interesting themes which you'll discover through optional notes, similar to other games in the Immersive Sim genre. <br><br>If you want you could upgrade your Bug with a shotgun right from the start and try blasting your way through the game, but the real fun is in experimenting with the game's kit of weird and wonderful abilities like remotely dominating enemy robots, teleporting yourself out of trouble, or setting traps that your enemies will run into. <br><br>The game's slightly dated visuals and clumsy robot physics add a certain charm to an already very unique game, and it's got a playable demo so give it a try and see what kind of mess you can make of things.			</div>

																This is what a true indie game should feel like. At first it was confusing with a steep learning curve, but then suddenly everything made sense. This game is like a puzzle metroidvania.			</div>

																Fantastic immersive sim that really scratches that problem solving itch in the best way possible, and includes a ton of cat photos which is always appreciated. I also want to give the developer a shout out for getting back to me within an hour of emailing them from their website about a feature request. Really glad to see that!			</div>

																Really enjoyable Immersive Sim so far. Demo is very generous (got sucked in for about two hours) so plenty of time to give it a go to make up your own mind.<br><br>Does take a little bit to get used to the mechanics and some of the tutorials can be a little vague/ hidden behind hints but if you pay close attention to your environment and experiment (which the game encourages) you'll quickly see the flexibility the game allows it's players to have. <br><br>It embraces the 'here's all the tools, off you go' mindset and the level design gives so many routes and option to tackle problems, I keep wondering what else I could have done if I go back - already thinking about a second play through before I've finished the first. Tickles the problem solving brain just right.			</div>

																This is THE best puzzle game I have ever played, haven't finished it yet but it's a true Immersive Sim on the level of Deus Ex and Prey, so far I'm not really hooked into the story and that's the only thing missing from this game otherwise it's a must buy for any puzzle game enjoyer			</div>

																One of the best games I've played this year. As an Immersive Sim, it avoids the Play Your Way = Play According to Stat Allocation pitfalls that many of these games do, instead providing incredibly tight encounter and puzzle design, mixed with a gloriously abusable toolset. <br><br>I had stupid amounts of fun with this. An easy recommend.			</div>

																What a loveable and fun game, the story has a lot of heart, the mechanics are easy to pick up and play with, and it looks great! I very much took my time exploring and making mistakes, which was very enjoyable. Highly recommended for fans of the Deus Ex series, System shock, Prey, etc.			</div>

																truly a hidden gem! took me 15hrs to clear all 8 chapters. (i took it slow, most will probably beat it faster than me.)  i've seen many compare this to other popular im-sims, which is why i bought it, but it has so many of its own great ideas that it truly sets itself apart from those other titles.  it's not an imitator - it's a peer and an equal to those other titles!  <br><br>it shocked me how many tools i had to problem solve and to explore the world.  it really allows for the creativity and expression that i really look for in a good game, and especially a good im-sim.<br><br>the story is more compelling than i expected.<br><br>it did take me about an hour to get hooked, but i'm so glad i gave it that time!  it is one of the best games i've played this year!			</div>

																yep, probs a new classic imersive sim if you ask me. <br>I was kinda scared that the whole, disembodied counsciousness thing would end up being tiring and more of a gimmick rather than anything else. but I was wrong, gameplay wise, the numerous bots and equipments you're allowed to use can shake up the gameplay quite a bit. <br><br>althought one of my complaint would be that same upgrades feel abit redundant (for example the gun and the drill, wich both essentially acehive the same thing but one is much harder to properly use and feels more like a point sink than the other.).<br>apart from that, the upgrades don't feel out of place in universe and still fit the aesthetic of the game rather well. <br>in terms of level design and secrets, the maps/chapters are big enough to hide alot of,upgrade points (who make a sound if you're close enough to one, wich has been really usefull). <br>so yeah, I'd recommend this game to anyone who's already familiar with the immersive sim genra or just likes puzzle games.			</div>

																Great little indie immersive sim. I especially like the "deathless" nature of the game, because it encourages emergent gameplay more than a traditional save feature that can lead to save scumming.<br><br>Highly recommended for any fans of the genre.			</div>

																This is exactly what I've been looking for. I haven't completed it yet (and I'll update this review when I do) but if you're looking for a new 'immersive sim' and Prey maybe didn't go far enough for you, this is it. It's smart, has great level design, and it's pretty funny to boot. Huge recommend.<br><br>Serializing is one of the cleverest video game mechanics I can think of.			</div>
