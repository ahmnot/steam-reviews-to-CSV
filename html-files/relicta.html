																Overall, Relicta is an enjoyable, if not occasionally frustrating first person physics puzzler that I would recommend if you are a fan of the genre or you like pretending you are Magneto by surfing flying boxes using the power of magnets and levitation. <br><br>As a disclaimer: I would recommend anybody who plays to cap their framerates at 60 fps to avoid issues with boxes not flying in the correct trajectories, as 60fps seems to be what the physics were tuned for. This will probably save you hours of frustration, softlocks and restarting if my experience is anything to go by. There are also DX11 and DX12 versions of the game, but I'm unsure if there is a difference to gameplay.<br><br>The puzzles are a mixed bag, where the good largely outweighs the bad. There are a lot of clever puzzles in this game that require experimentation and cumulative understanding of the game's physics. Only a few puzzles felt like a breeze to complete first try. The bonus puzzles added after release are even more challenging. This is partly owing to the design but also to the annoying length of some puzzles in the game, especially the last two levels of the main game. The lack of checkpoints in the middle of lengthy, multi-staged puzzles, combined with the occasional instances of softlocking do bring down the enjoyment of otherwise nicely designed sequences. They are still fun to play.<br><br>The story is quite prevelent in comparison to other puzzlers in the genre and I found it to be a nice backdrop to the puzzles, the player receiving an update after every puzzle or so. During the second act, the story starts to drag and the characters started to feel less realistic, but it picks up again towards the end and reaches a nice conclusion, depending on your choice. The VA is well done and makes the dialogue feel believable. Some jokes made me chuckle while others made me wince a bit. If you're not into the story, the game wont force you to listen as most of the dialogue and cutscenes are skippable and your enjoyment of the puzzles wont be diminished.<br><br>There's a lot of content here to keep your brain ticking and its worth the price, especially if on sale, considering how much time can be sunk into launching boxes and standing on switches. I think this game stands up on its own merits, that being said, there are plenty of other, better, FPP games to whet your apatite if this is your first foray into the genre.<br><br>Regardless, I would recommend trying out the demo if you're unsure about picking this up.<br><br>TL,DR: Nice puzzles, the narrative is nice and fun, just make sure to cap framrate at 60fps.			</div>

																<div class="bb_h1"><i>Challenging puzzles and a cool story, but disconnected.</i></div><br><div class="bb_h2"><i>-<u>Overview</u>-</i></div><i>Relicta</i> is a linear, first-person puzzle game similar to <i>Portal</i> and <i>The Turing Test</i>.  Both its puzzles and its story are decent, though there is a sense of disconnect between the two. The puzzles are numerous and grow to be quite difficult, which dramatically slows the feeling of progression, and the existence of the puzzles themselves holds a somewhat flimsy connection to the story, making the gameplay feel disconnected from the narrative.  <br><br>Taking AFK time out of the equation, completion took me 15-16 hours — 6-8 hours longer than I would expect from this type of game. <br><br><blockquote class="bb_blockquote">🎮<i>Relicta can be played with both keyboard/mouse and controller.  Both can be re-bound.</i>🎮</blockquote><br><div class="bb_h2"><i>-<u>Gameplay</u>-</i></div><div class="bb_h3">Basics:</div>Relicta's gameplay will likely feel familiar to those who have played the aforementioned similar titles; it features a first-person perspective, device for manipulating the environment and objects, and an ever-present A.I. to talk to between puzzles.  Players cannot die or suffer ill effects.<br><br>Aiming and moving feel smooth and precise, if a little restricted.  On occasion, a puzzle segment could be solved or bypassed if the player character were able to simply crouch or climb, which is potentially a bit immersion-breaking.<br><br><div class="bb_h3">Puzzles:</div>The core mechanics are the ability to change the polarity of certain objects to repel or attract each other, and to remove the affect of gravity on cubes, allowing them to fly through the air —  sometimes with you riding them.  It's a system that often requires players to think several steps in advance, in order to get the cubes and themselves past the myriad of obstacles present.  Various new environmental mechanics such as barriers and mobile platforms continue to be introduced right up to the end of the game.<br><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2239193239" class="dynamiclink_box modalContentLink  ugc" data-modal-content-sizetofit="true" data-appid="941570" data-publishedfileid="2239193239">

	</div>
</a><br>In the latter half of the game, puzzles quickly grow more complex, to the point of being a convoluted mess at first glance.  On occasion I found it easiest to find the end goal and work backwards to discover just where I was supposed to start.  These puzzles take some time to complete, and often the reward for doing so is a three second walk to another, equally complex cluster of cables, buttons and barriers.  This is where my biggest issue with the game begins. <br><br>Though I don't mind a challenging puzzle, doing several complex yet very similar ones in a row with little in between begins to feel repetitive and tiring, and made me want to play the game in short burts.  Now, that's fine when the game is just a casual puzzle game, but <i>Relicta</i> is a linear story game, and I feel the density of gameplay content halts story progression significantly, as the puzzles contain little relevance to the narrative.  For this reason, as well as the complexity of many of the later puzzles, I think the game's pacing and accessibility would be improved greatly by relegating many of the levels (harder ones, especially) to optional content, making the story experience smoother and less repetitive. <br><br><div class="bb_h3">World Design:</div>Set in a near-future sci-fi moon base featuring several distinct biomes, <i>Relicta</i> offers great visual variety.  Working in various craters near the base, scientists have created small natural biomes on the moon, including lush jungle, tropical beach, arid desert and more.  Though these areas are beautiful and distinct, their differences don't really translate to gameplay.  The base itself, which players travel though between puzzle sections, is a great piece of design, with extensive decorative objects and equipment, beautiful natural features blended with the architecture, and a very high level of detail overall.  I wish I'd got to spend more time there, interacting with the environment.<br><br><div class="bb_h2"><i>-<u>Story</u>-</i></div><i>Relicta's</i> story is told through the eyes of Doctor Angelica Patel, one of a small team of scientists occupying a base on Earth's moon.  The base was established by a previous group, and contains a strange alien artefact known as the <i>Relicta</i>.  Using scientific knowledge gleaned from this artefact, the past and present scientists have created technology far beyond humanity's current level.  An example of this is the gloves that allow Patel to manipulate her environment in the ways described above. <br><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2239203086" class="dynamiclink_box modalContentLink  ugc" data-modal-content-sizetofit="true" data-appid="941570" data-publishedfileid="2239203086">

			A few collectables are available that offer some insight into the backstory of the locations, characters and game world as a whole. These are located inside the base only, which is a shame.		</div>
	</div>
</a><br>The existence of the gloves and puzzle tracks designed to test them is briefly explained, but has rather an odd fit with the rest of the story.  Every one of the biomes connected to the base features a puzzle track, which is apparently the only way to navigate them, even when there's a vital piece of base infrastructure — such as a generator — at the other end.  Invisible barriers also prevent any deviation from the path.  Things go very wrong for the protagonist throughout the story, and she constantly needs to be at the other end of a puzzle track.  Conveniently, the tracks are all unable to be switched off for some reason or other, forcing her to complete every one in its entirety.<br><br>Besides Doctor Patel, <i>Relicta</i> features a few other voiced characters, and I found the voice acting, story telling and characters to be of pretty high quality, barring the protagonist having some dumb moments occasionally. The humour is good, and I enjoyed many of the exchanges later in the game.  <i>Relicta</i> manages its time well by focusing its efforts on a small number of characters and relationships.  Unfortunately, dialogue would sometimes be cut off by moving into the next area too soon, causing me to stand still and wait to make sure I heard everything, rather than getting started on the next puzzle. <br><br>Some of the biomes feature decorative structures or features that cannot be reached due to the invisible walls, but would be ideal places to find collectables.  This would also offer a short break and some variety between large puzzles.  A missed opportunity, I feel. <br><br><div class="bb_h2"><i>-<u>Technical</u>-</i></div><blockquote class="bb_blockquote"><b>This game was played with the following PC specs:</b><br>Intel i5-4440 3.10 GHz<br>16GB DDR3 RAM<br>GeForce GTX 1650 SUPER 4GB<br>1680x1050 resolution<br>HDD<br>Windows 10</blockquote><div class="bb_h3">Visuals:</div><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2239178011" class="dynamiclink_box modalContentLink  ugc" data-modal-content-sizetofit="true" data-appid="941570" data-publishedfileid="2239178011">

																Really beautiful puzzle game. Puzzles that increase in difficulty as the game progresses and what really amazes is certainly the graphics and the photo mode (not easy to find in an indie game). A sore point is certainly the plot which lacks bite and given that the game is particularly long, it could get boring. All in all the price is adequate considering other games similar to this one. 7/10 my rating.			</div>

																I loved the general concept. The graphics, the dialogue and the slight mystery in the middle of it all. But I think this a perfect example of a game which overstays it's welcome big time. When I got to about half way, I thought I got near the end and some big story moment is coming in. Aaaand then the game just sends me back to solve another bunch of puzzles again and again.<br><br>As I've said the concept is interesting, really good in fact, but it has only so much to offer and after about 5 hours the ramp up in difficulty really stalled and I just got more and more tedious levels. Levels where I could kinda see how to solve them right off the bat, but I knew it would take 10-15 minutes to actually execute it properly. Also after a while maps just became all about clustering a lot of things into a single zone or making a single puzzle consist of multiple zones. So again, the difficulty wasn't really solving an interesting puzzle, but trying to see through the mess of options you have in your face.<br><br>I's a real shame.			</div>

																Um ótimo jogo de puzzles pra qm gosta, lembra levemente o The Turing Test por ser em primeira pessoa e de curta duração (pode ser finalizado em 3-4 horas) com lindos gráficos e várias mecânicas interessantes. Embora tenham vários e vários enigmas diferentes, grande parte deles são baseados em blocos qe devem ser manuseados para desbloquear passagens, porém mta coisa é acrescentada a cada “nível”, incluindo teleportes e efeitos de física e tecnologia bem diversificados e qe possibilitam criar uma gama de desafios únicos. É claro qe se vcê não for mto fã de puzzles não vai gostar de Relicta, afinal ele não tem mta ação e é totalmente focado nos enigmas, tendo também uma história de background qe dá sentido aos cenários e acontecimentos, incrementando toda experiência pra qm tiver interesse.			</div>

																Seemed fine, but gets increasingly more annoying as the game progresses.<br><br>This is a puzzle game, there are several principles that you DO NOT break:<br>1. Dont hide parts of the puzzle. So many times I've found out that HEY THERE WAS A PANEL BEHIND THAT BUT I CANT SEE IT.<br>2. Dont put mechanics that only serve to screw the player. "Look, there's a corner here with a green screen. Why? To trap your box and force to reset your progress."<br>3. Make sure your mechanics WORK ALWAYS, not just sometimes.<br>This game breaks all of them, much to the frustration of the player.<br><br>The story is bad, and only serves to make the game longer. The lobby sequences are unnecessarily big and confusing. Something should only serve to take you to the next puzzle is a maze itself, with many long corridors and unnecessary travel sequences.<br><br>AVOID			</div>

																Really challenging first person puzzle with astonishing visuals! Also, it's been really optimized, 60fps at 1920x1080 in ultra settings with a NVidia GTX 960 (which is a 4 years old video card!)<br><br>Absolutely recommended if you're into games like Portal, Braid or The Witness.			</div>

																Головоломки – это сложный жанр. В первую очередь потому что очень непросто сделать игру, способную зацепить не только человека, для которого бесконечное решение паззлов один за другим уже само по себе является отличным развлечением и единственным требованием. Дилогия Portal в конце нулевых выступила тому подтверждением, предоставив игрокам не только отличный челлендж в виде головоломок варьирующейся степени сложности, но и захватывающий сюжет, конфликт между персонажами, проработанный лор и юмор, вошедший в золотой фонд цитат на долгие годы вперёд. А затем пошли такие игры, как The Ball, Q.U.B.E., Antichamber, и у них у всех была одна общая проблема – они были уже сами по себе не настолько увлекательными, чтобы предоставить какой-то интересный опыт помимо череды однообразных шарад. The Talos Principle с его размышлениями на тему трансгуманизма и ломанием четвёртой стены выступил более весомо и оригинально, что подтвердила его популярность у большей части сообщества. А что же Relicta, новый представитель жанра из инди-сегмента от студии Mighty Polygon?<br>Главная героиня – учёный Анжелика Патель, которая работает на лунной научно-исследовательской станции и занимается изучением устройств, способных менять гравитацию и магнитные полярности. Однажды ей звонит её дочь Кира, решившая прилететь и присоединиться к матери в её работе после окончания университета, но уже на подлёте неожиданно происходит некая поломка, система отключается, а коллеги Анжелики оказываются заперты в отдельных исследовательских зонах, поэтому ей срочно приходится двигаться им на помощь и разобраться с произошедшими сбоями. А по пути, соответственно, преодолеть кучу головоломок.<br>Про сюжет в целом я ничего сказать не могу, потому как не прошёл игру, но с самого начала завязка сама по себе не предлагает ничего особенно удивительного или интригующего. Более того, куцые диалоги разве что дают повод возненавидеть другую женщину-учёного, которая постоянно наезжает на главную героиню (если она на самом деле злодейка, я бы не удивился ни капельки). А бэкграунд самой базы и её обитателей раскрываются в основном через разные записки, разбросанные там и сям, и то ничего занятного, кроме упоминаний клишированных вещей вроде превращения таинственного артефакта (той самой «Реликты») в оружие, в них мне не попадалось. Ещё хуже, что даже при таком скудном сторителлинге игра умудряется ставить галочки насчёт обязательных пунктов по SJW и толерастии. Как говорится, вряд ли кто-то, кого это волнует, поиграет, но мало ли.<br> Что касается головоломной части – она в общем-то и стала причиной потери всякого моего интереса к игре, потому как потенциально интересные задачки с гравитацией и полярностями были напрочь убиты сразу кучей элементов. Во-первых, все встреченные мной паззлы за три часа игры сводились к одним и тем же перемещениям кубов на кнопки, причём перемещениям долгим, однообразным и унылым. Во-вторых, может, конечно, это я просто тупой, но множество особенностей игровых механик работают крайне странно, а их использованию в игре не обучают вообще никак. Например, расстояние, на котором два куба или куб к источнику поля притягиваются друг к другу, каждый раз просто невозможно определить нормально – то они пролетают мимо друг друга, то слипаются в секунду. В-третьих, окончательно отбивают удовольствие и желание играть множественные условности, на которые, кажется, создатели специально положили болт, чтобы просто испортить игрокам жизнь. КАЖДОМУ кубу нужно ЗАНОВО выставлять полярность и гравитацию после того, как ты просто его ВЗЯЛ. А учитывая, что кубы вам приходится перемещать постоянно, вы будете забывать нажимать каждый раз гравитацию, падать и совершать ещё больше действий. Только не надо искать этому игромеханических оправданий – это просто неудобно, и точка. И конечно, сами по себе кубы физики не имеют, и приседать главная героиня не умеет (а ведь на этом завязаны головоломки!), и вообще, когда игра на загрузочном экране предупреждает, что проседание FPS может вызвать ошибки в физике объектов, хочется только поаплодировать такому вниманию к аудитории.<br>Визуально игра производит действительно приятное впечатление – Unreal Engine, как-никак. Однако местные красоты и пейзажи уже ничего не значат, когда сталкиваешься с беспощадным и уродливым левел-дизайном. Провалитесь в какую-то трещину или застрянете между камнями – ваши проблемы. И да, если в «Принципе Талоса» вы вдоволь могли побегать по локациям, то здесь невидимые стены и потолки не дадут вам просто шагу ступить в сторону. Серьёзно, в коридорах базы ощущаешь себя просторнее, нежели на поверхности. По поводу саундтрека ничего сказать не могу, я его особо не заметил. А значит, и говорить о нём не стоит.<br>Ну и что в итоге? Relicta – это ещё одна головоломка, которая вынужденно уйдёт в небытие. Потому как примитивный сюжет, условности уровня 2004 года (и то, тогда уже был Half-Life 2, так что всё ещё печальнее) и душные однообразные головоломки без толики оригинальности уже давно не являются мелочами, на которые можно просто закрыть глаза. Советую пройти мимо, если конечно, вы не заядлый любитель поломать себе мозг. И то, конкурентов у сего «опуса» полно, а достойных тем более.<br>Оценка: 4 из 10 – плохо (не пройдена).			</div>

																how can this game have such review scores?<br>+ nice graphics<br>- wasting your time walking and moving back and forth in bland soulless corridors<br>- has some bugs like glitching cubes that wont react anymore to your input<br>- non elegant puzzles that instead of making you feel clever are just easy but long and make you walk a lot with no meaning to it other than to pad gameplay time<br>- copying other puzzle games elements with no reason without understanding why those elements worked in them<br>- janky puzzles + sometimes not putting save points that makes you restart the level because of some janky puzzle that gets stuck<br>- bad choices in telegraphing interactivity and inconsistent meaning for colors <br>- if you're going to put a story to a puzzle game , at least try harder to  give some plausible excuse for why your character keeps solving those puzzles<br> <br><br>this is one of the worst puzzle games of that type that I've played , before you waste you're time on it<br>you should first play games that actually have a soul like:<br>- portal 1 &amp; 2<br>- The Talos Principle<br>- The Witness<br>- Antichamber			</div>

																pfffiuuu, just finished the game and man... so many things in mind. First of all great game, so many ideas of puzzle rooms. Might not be recommended for those who are reluctant to mid to hardcore puzzle games. <br>Now, concerning the mass of puzzle rooms, a certain number are very good and well thought. Others are made complex to look like they are complex just by hiding some perspectives or making some objects not noticeable. To give an example, there is a puzzle room in the jungle where I spent hours either because an object was blocked and I had to reset, or because I did not see an element hidden in the field and I progressed without having this element activated.<br>Also, the physics of the objects made me solve puzzles in a way that would not, I guess, have been expected by the developers. <br>Finally, the usage of the 'F' word almost at each sentence (this is how I perceived it at the end). Usually, I do not really care, but when you accomplish a puzzle that took you quite some time, you are satisfied, but the reward from the game is just a discussion between the protagonist mostly based on swear words... you are just in a hurry that they stop talking. The story is interesting, but detaches from all the puzzles. The scenario is just an excuse for making a lot of puzzles, which is fine for me, but there is this little touch that this game lacks from being at the level of a talos or a qube2-dlc. This does not prevent me from recommending this game. I am really addict to this kind of game.			</div>

																This game suffers from several issues that would require massive overhauls to fix. As it is, I definitely don't recommend the game for puzzle fans nor for people looking for a good story. There's none of that here.<br><br><br><div class="bb_h1">Main problem: Artificial difficulty</div><br>Puzzles in Relicta are very repetitive. The progression feels incredibly slow due to the fact you're doing the exact same thing for multiple test chambers straight, only in different biomes.<br><br>Everything boils down to manipulating cubes to push a distant button that opens a door. It's all you do in the game: grab a cube and gravitize it red/blue/yellow, so it moves where you want it to move. In the latter half of the game a new mechanic appears every 10 levels, but it also involves transporting cubes, just in a different way. Cubes, cubes, cubes. Everything is cubes.<br><br>The more you play, the longer the levels become. They're not getting any more difficult, just more tedious due to increased length and complexity. Instead of using the mechanics in a inventive way, the puzzles require more cubes to press more buttons, and the test chambers are visibly split into multiple independent sections. You don't need to think harder, just need to repeat the actions you've already done a dozen times or find out the order by walking around the huge areas over and over.<br><br>To further increase the artificial difficulty, the cubes you need to solve the puzzle are sometimes hidden around the test location, so you need to scout the area before attempting to solve it. This is a learned skill in Relicta. If you don't look around first, you'll repeat my mistake of flying on a single cube, wondering what the hell to do, until you notice there's another cube on the other side of a tall structure. Since getting these cubes is trivial, they could just as well be provided from the start without making it so difficult to spot them. What a terrible puzzle design choice.<br><br>Finally, the worst thing related to puzzles: You aren't really sure if what you did was correct. You could even be doing the right thing, but due to physics engine tied to framerate, it might not work the first two times and only pass if you try again. You could be surfing a cube across the map and get stuck, because the developers didn't think of this approach. You never know for sure.<br><br><br><div class="bb_h1">Voice acting</div><br>The voice acting is equally poor. I don't mind hearing non-native speakers communicate in English, but their dialogues aren't believable; no cutscene evokes any emotion other than pity for the poor actor that had to use an expletive again.<br><br>What's more, the characters constantly "interrupt" each other. I'm putting "interrupt" in quotation marks, because what's happening is a character stopping mid-thought, <b>a literal second passing</b>, and another character saying something. This is happening Every. Single. Time.<br><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li> AI: "I advise you to—"<br></li><li> <i>One second passes</i><br></li><li> Character: "Shut the f--- up, I don't care."</li></ul><br>This feels fake, and since all dialogues are littered with these "interruptions", every cutscene becomes a pathetic exchange of detached sentences instead of a genuine conversation. It breaks all the immersion that the content of the dialogue could have built.<br><br><br><div class="bb_h1">Everything is huge</div><br>Every location is either an enormous hub, a long tunnel that's roughly 16 washing machines wide, or an "open" area.<br><br>Oh, look, quotation marks again. Why "open" and not open? Because there are <b>invisible walls</b> surrounding most places, and they're placed in such bizzarre spots that it's the funniest part of the game. In one place the character could literally jump down six feet and they could exit the level. But, ha ha! The developers are smart! There's an invisible wall preventing you from doing that. This joins the list of things that prevent Relicta from being believable.<br><br>An inviting house on the beach? Can't get there, there's an invisible wall. A fork on the road? Can't go left, there's an invisible wall. A literal wall made of rocks? Yeah, there's an <b>additional</b> invisible wall in front of it, just in case. It's hilarious.<br><br><br><div class="bb_h1">Summary</div><br>Absolutely don't waste your time playing Relicta like I did. It doesn't respect your time, doesn't test your wit, and doesn't reward your efforts with a good plot.<br><br>Avoid.			</div>

																非常に丁寧に作られた良作。3Dアクションパズルが好きであれば文句なしにおすすめです。<br><br>ジャンルとしては「PORTAL」に近いです。この作品では、ブロックやパネルに「正極」と「負極」を付与できるグローブを使って磁石のようにモノを引き付けたり反発させたりしながら物理パズルを解いていきます。<br><br>ユニークなのは、ブロックに対しては上記に加えて「無重力状態」が付与できることです。これを付与した状態で力が加わると、ブロックは滑るように空間を移動します。これを利用することで、ブロックを遠くまで飛ばしたり、天井や壁にあるスイッチを押したり、さらには自分がそれに乗って移動手段にできたりします。やってみると分かりますが、これのお陰でパズルにバラエティが生まれていて面白いです。<br><br>非常に嬉しいのは完璧に日本語訳がされていること。ストーリーはほぼ他の登場人物との通信による会話劇で進んでいきますが、翻訳には全く違和感がありません。またゲーム内にあるドキュメント等の文書もきちんと翻訳されています。素晴らしい。<br><br><div class="bb_h1">良い点 </div>・磁力をモチーフにしたユニークなゲームシステム<br>・丁寧なレベルデザイン<br>・豊富なロケーション<br>・王道ながら良質なSFストーリー<br>・完璧な日本語訳<br><br><div class="bb_h1">悪い点 </div>・終盤では少々シビアなタイミングが求められる場面がある<br>・ごく稀にブロックが手の届かないところにスタックすることがある<br>（いつでもレベルの最初までリセットすることができるため大きな問題にはならないが）			</div>

																Recommended with caveats. Relicta is in the same class of physics-puzzlers as Portal, Talos Principal, Antichamber, etc. If you liked any of them, Relicta definitely belongs on your wishlist... but not at the top.<br><br>Relicta has a huge number of fun puzzles - it's really good value for money if you're in the mood for them. The problem is that Relicta is really not as polished as the others. The story's sufficiently interesting, but almost all characters are impatient and snarky, making them quite unpleasant to listen to. The hub map is a completely unnecessary sprawling maze full of easy-to-miss collectables that only add frustration to the experience. Many of the puzzles (especially in the DLC) are excessively long, meaning you have to replay a lot every time you ragequit/softlock and have to reset. If I wasn't already hooked on the puzzles, there were many moments where I would have just stopped playing.<br><br>So basically, Relicta isn't the game that will get you hooked on this genre, but it's a good hit to feed the addiction. Play the other major physics-puzzler games first.			</div>

																-- <b> Relicta | Deutsche Review </b> -- <br><br><b> Zusammenfassung: </b> <br><br>Bei Relicta handelt es sich um einen First-Person-Puzzler, welcher trotz wenig variierender Mechaniken durch seine intelligenten Rätsel sowie seine lineare, aber dennoch humorvolle Geschichte überzeugen kann. <b> 9/10 </b>.<br><br><b> Ausführliche Review</b>:<br><br>Relicta lässt sich am ehesten mit <b>Portal 2</b> oder <b>The Talos Principle</b> vergleichen. Fast alle Mechaniken im Spiel beruhen auf Gravitationsmanipulation sowie Magnetismus. Das in der nahen Zukunft angesetzte Setting überzeugt durch eine bilderschöne Grafik und eine durchaus ansprechende Geschichte. Wer ein Open-World Erlebnis oder eine tiefgreifende Geschichte sucht, sollte allerdings seine Finger von Relicta lassen.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>Grafik</b>:<br><br>Auf meinem PC lief das Spiel auf maximalen Einstellungen in 4k problemlos (allerdings auch kein Referenzwert, da RTX 2080ti &amp; i9 9900k). Laut Diskussionsforen sind niedrigere Framerates durchaus ein Problem, da dadurch die Physikengine ins Stocken gerät. <br><br>Die in sehr unterschiedlichen Biomen angesetzten Areale sind gerade für solch einen Indie-Titel einfach umwerfend. Der Mix aus Wüstencanyon, Regenwald und frostigem Schnee (um nur einige Beispiele zu nennen) beeindruckt auf den ersten Blick, was jedes neue Areal auch zu einem echten Hingucker macht. <b> 5/5 </b>.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>Leveldesign</b>:<br><br>Während das HUB und alle darin enthaltenen Collectibles fast das ganze Spiel über erreichbar sind, werden die einzelnen Areale in linearer Reihenfolge durchlaufen. Das macht storytechnisch Sinn, kann aber für Frust sorgen, da kein Rätsel übersprungen werden kann - auch Hinweise gibt es nicht. Während die Rätsel sehr trivial beginnen, steigt der Schwierigkeitsgrad angenehm an - bei mir persönlich traten kaum Frustmomente auf. Viele spielverändernde Mechaniken werden in <i> Relicta </i> nicht eingeführt, was die Rätsel gegen Ende etwas repetitiv und gestreckt wirken lässt. Dennoch werden wir oft auf unterschiedliche Art und Weise gefordert, es handelt sich bei Relicta definitiv um einen Puzzler und <b> keinen </b> Walking-Sim. <b> 4/5 </b>.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>Story</b>: <br><br>Ohne zu viel zu verraten: Relicta spielt in der nahen Zukunft, nach dem Ende eines Orbitalkrieges, über den wir mittels Collectables so einiges erfahren können - wenngleich das gänzlich optimal ist und im Spiel keinen sichtlichen Einfluss hat. Viel bedeutender ist da dieses rätselhafte ... Ding, genannt <b> Relicta </b>. Aus Spoilergründen kann ich hier nicht weiter in die Tiefe gehen, das Spiel entwickelt sich aber durchaus interessant und hat einige humorvolle Passagen dabei. Wenngleich das Ende vorhersehbar ist, hat die Geschichte meine niedrigen Erwartungen deutlich übertroffen und mir bei den letzten Rätselpassagen sogar die entscheidende Motivation geliefert, fortzufahren. <b> 4/5 </b>.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>Musik</b>:<br><br>Die Musik tritt in den Hintergrund. Sie passt, hinterlässt aber keinen bleibenden Eindruck. Einige Höhepunkte werden gut unterstrichen, ansonsten gibt es hier nicht viel zu sagen. <b> 3/5 </b>.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>Sonstige Infos &amp; Achievements</b>:<br><br>Mein erster Spieldurchlauf von <i> Relicta </i> nahm etwa <b> 12 Stunden </b> in Anspruch - von welchen ich geschätzt 2 auf der Suche nach Collectables, im HUB oder mit der Hintergrundgeschichte der Welt verbracht habe. Ein 2. Spieldurchlauf ist als Achievementjäger dringend notwendig, da das Spiel dafür binnen 6 Stunden durchgespielt werden muss. So bin ich insgesamt auf eine Spielzeit von knapp über <b> 17 Stunden </b> gekommen - Preis / Leistung passt dafür völlig.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>Vor- und Nachteile</b>:<br><br>+ Wunderschöne Areale<br>+ Durchaus packende Geschichte mit humorvollen Passagen<br>+ Anfordernde Rätsel, angenehmer Anstieg im Schwierigkeitsgrad<br>+ Collectables, welche es einem komplett optional ermöglichen, sich mit der Welt zu beschäftigen<br><br>0 Musik sticht nicht besonders hervor<br><br>- Nicht überspringbare Puzzles können mangels Hinweisen zu Frust führen <br>- Wenig Entscheidungsmöglichkeiten; die 2 verschiedenen Enden wären nicht unbedingt notwendig gewesen<br>- Puzzles werden gegen Ende leicht repetitiv<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>Fazit</b>:<br><br><i> Relicta </i> ist eines dieser Spiele, von welchen ich viel weniger erwartet habe, als sie mir geliefert haben. Neben der einladenden Grafik haben mich persönlich sowohl die Story als auch die Puzzleelemente begeistert, für 20€ erhält <i> Relicta </i> von mir eine Kaufempfehlung für alle Rätselliebhaber. <br><br><b> 9/10 </b><br><i>Meine Nominierung zum Spiel des Jahres 2020</i><br><br><br><i> Danke für's Lesen meiner Review! Ich freue mich über einen Kommentar, eine andere Meinung oder sonstiges, da ich mir für meine Tests immer viel Zeit lasse. Ich hoffe, ich konnte Dir bei deiner Kaufentscheidung behilflich sein! :) </i>			</div>

																<a class="bb_link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/curator/30168383" target="_blank" rel=""> If you liked the review and interested in completion and perfection time of games with additional useful information (for example: how difficult to get all achievements, is MP or DLC required and so on) or interested in reviews like this, then please follow my Average Achievement Hunter curator.               </a><br><br>Relicta is a puzzle game and actually the best one I have played since Talos Principle.<br><br><div class="bb_h1">Game received for free. Is this a paid review?</div><br>My reviews always represent my own opinion. I am not a reviewer / curator who plays/idle each game for 30mins then writes some crap about the game. As you can see from my playtime (and achievements) I finished the game, created videos, guides about the game so I experienced the whole content. Additionally, feel free to check my reviews, I have negatives on “games received for free” if that is what reflects my opinion on that game.<br><br><div class="bb_h1">The story</div><br>.As usually, I don’t want to reveal too much of the story. You play as a female scientist on a moon base who is trying to find the secrets of an alien object. That object, the Relicta is actually a living entity and slowly infiltrating your mind.<br><br><div class="bb_h1">Puzzle variability</div><br>Game includes 9 different puzzle areas + the 2 tutorial areas. That means about 50 different puzzle locations without the tutorial levels. Each area includes new mechanics so the game never gets boring, it stays refreshing, interesting and keeps offering new challenges. You also need to be creative, you need to think about all you could do while you use magnetism effect and anti gravitational effect on the cubes. The new tricks are not shown to you in every single area.<br><br>Update April/May 2021: Game has now 2 extra story, each with 12, hard levels. These levels very challenging, complex and long, literally doubling the playtime Relicta offers.<br><br><div class="bb_h1">Minor problems</div><br>The perfect game is not existing. Every single one, even good ones has some minor issues or something we dislike in it. For me these were:<br><br>-between puzzle areas you can explore the moonbase. However, these areas feel empty. Yes, there are collectibles for some lore, but still, these areas are a bit boring.<br>-physics puzzle games will never be perfect. My cube levitates to one direction while it has a zero gravity effect on it, then hits a wall. Shouldn’t it start to levitate to the other direction because of the force it had by the collision to the wall? Well, I believe that would make a game extremely difficult and more random and this is why more logical puzzles, like Talos Principle will stay better, even if just slightly.<br><br><div class="bb_h1">Conclusion</div><br>Relicta is great. It will train your brain. One of the best puzzle game of 2020 for sure, definitely worth its price. If you love puzzle games then this is a MUST TO PLAY.<br><br><b>Story: 8/10</b><br><b>Replay value: 3/10</b> You probably won't remember the solution of all puzzles, so perhaps replayable once, but such games usually are not good for replaying. Perhaps after a few years...<br><b>Atmosphere: 9/10</b> <br><b>Visuals: 9/10</b> Characters look cute, enemies have some nice graphics too, it is a visually pleasant game. The best part of the game.<br><b>Gameplay mechanics: 8/10</b> Physics based puzzle games always have some minor problems, RNG in executing this, this is not an exception but it is close to perfection.<br><b>Music/Sound effects: 9/10</b> <br><b>Narration/Voice acting: 10/10</b> Some say accents on characters are bad. I quite love it actually. It is totally understandable, clear, but also gives some charm to the characters. English became a global language but I believe 80% of humanity, or more speaking it with accent, me included, so negative reviews just because of this is just another clear sign of the anglo-american imperialist suppression.<br><b>Game difficulty: 7/10</b> Some puzzles hard to figure out, but if you like puzzle games then you should be able to figure out each of them. Still stuck somewhere? Then check out my walkthrough where I also explain what I'm doing during puzzles so you can solve it easily.

																So far, the puzzles have been nice but fiddly and somewhat clunky. They may devolve when physics and timing become more of an issue in later puzzles - even in these first couple of hours, I've often had to perform the exact same maneuver several times to get a cube in the right spot due to the fiddly physics. It's been a good challenge nonetheless and I can see the appeal of all the puzzle mechanics. <br><br>The things that really broke the game for me were the story, characters, and save system. The main characters are supposed to be mature, high functioning scientists, and yet it seems what they do all day is bicker at each other. The story itself doesn't fit the puzzles at all. You have to undergo urgent rescue missions and whatnot, but you get stuck behind these puzzles for hours at a time and the story essentially has no acknowledgement of the time spent. In terms of the saves - the game only autosaves between puzzles. Sometimes puzzles can take a long time to finish and are essentially segmented into multiple small sections. Due to the physics, sometimes you can accidentally push a cube back into a previous section and have to redo everything. I think the game really needs manual save slots.<br><br>I also didn't see the point in all the collectables lying around in the zones in between the puzzle areas - it seems like they were just added because other games have collectables. One of my other complaints is the large size of these in-between zones.  If not for the collectables, they could have been shrunk by probably 90% or more. <br><br>If you're just looking for a game to scratch that first person puzzler itch, Relicta will probably be a good choice albeit a bit more clunky compared to other titles. For me, at least, the overall cohesion between the puzzles and the story just wasn't there, so I can't recommend it.			</div>

																Si vous avez adoré Portal 2 (mais qui n'a pas aimé ?) et que vous souhaitez retrouver un peu de l'essence de ce chef d'œuvre du jeu vidéo avec ce qui est en définitive un <b>puzzle game solo très sympathique</b>, Relicta est fait pour vous.<br><br>Côté audio comme visuel, il n'y a rien de véritablement exceptionnel : <a class="bb_link" href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2832345850" target="_blank" rel="">les décors sont de temps en temps jolis</a> et quelques musiques sont correctes. Mais l'ambiance comme la qualité des environnements est de toute façon accessoire, car la force du jeu réside avant tout dans l'ingéniosité et le séquençage de ses nombreux niveaux/puzzles.<br><br>Encore plus accessoire voire carrément dispensable, et c'est un peu plus embêtant, est l'histoire du jeu. Là où un Portal 2 est délicieusement décalé, Relicta se prend au sérieux et la mayonnaise ne prend pas plus que ça. D'autant qu'on a un petit bout d'histoire après chaque puzzle accompli, ce qui donne une narration maladroite, hachée, car ce rythme n'a pas de véritable cohésion. Et du coup, on fini par zapper assez vite les dialogues et autres interludes qui donnent davantage l'impression de déranger plus qu'autre chose, pour ne se concentrer que sur les puzzles.<br><br>D'ailleurs, j'ai senti une correction de trajectoire des développeurs avec l'un des deux DLCs gratuits, celui nommé <i>Ice Queen</i> : <a class="bb_link" href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2832345767" target="_blank" rel="">certains environnements sont clairement inspirés de Portal 2</a> et les échanges sont un peu plus ludiques que lors de l'histoire principale... comme une tentative de clin d'œil à son illustre aîné ?			</div>

																I really tried to like this. It's very close to be excellent but they just didn't quite nail the very nebulous "good puzzle design" issue. I think the main problem I had is that the designer(s) treated every new level as building on all previous levels, not just conceptually but also mechanically. Almost every new puzzle mechanic, once introduced, is used in all future puzzles. And the game is long, easily twice as long as it needed to be. As the number of elements in a puzzle space rises, the available interactions go up exponentially. So by the end puzzles are these sprawling spaces with dozens of potential next steps to prune through which makes it feel more like random fumbling a lot of the time, as opposed to the sought after "a ha moment". Add to this that the mechanics are very "fiddly", you're often going to need to launch one cube off another an angle but there nothing in the game which snap it to the right place, you just have to eyeball it. It's very common to have the solution in your head but spend 20 minutes just wrangling the pieces into the right alignment. If they had made each segment about half the length and focused things to build reasoning skills about the game's world rather than just laying mechanics forever I think this could have been a real winner.<br><br>All the above is really a shame because the 3D art, lighting effects, sound, etc all completely gorgeous. I see in other reviews that some found the characters annoying and while I can see how they would rub some the wrong way, I really liked them. It felt like a very "real" set of people, more rough edges than sci-fi usually shows (swearing, being sarcastic, having an unpleasant phone call with an ex). The ending is a bit "and then it was over" but it does the job nicely in the context of a Portal-a-like lightweight story.<br><br>If you get frustrated part way through (I made it almost exactly halfway and then rage quit on one extra fiddly puzzle I had to completely restart 3 times), there's some excellent YouTube videos of the whole thing you can just blitz through to see the mechanics that get added and watch the ending, it was a much better way for me to experience the game and it might be for you too.			</div>

																果然，解谜游戏的本质就是推箱子。无论箱子是什么形式，推动它用什么手法，解谜的过程，就是把一个箱子推到属于它的洞里的过程。<br><br>RELICTA也概莫能外，无论是用磁力还是重力，传送还是抓取，它的最终目的都是把箱子放在充满诱惑力的按钮上，或是搭乘反重力箱子飞到悬崖峭壁旁。没有爱恨情仇，没有魑魅魍魉，不会扣人心弦，也不会起伏跌宕。无论景色如何变化，这里只有孤独的人，不变的按钮和箱。<br><br>与之相似的还有另一款解谜游戏《传送门》，可以说作为难得大火的解谜游戏，《传送门》对不少后来者都造成了深远的影响。粗略看来，这两款游戏在设计风格上非常接近，都是从一点核心出发构筑整个解谜环境，同时，也都是严格单解谜题。不得不说，RELICTA做的还是比较成功的。但还有一个很大的不同之处在于，《传送门》中的箱子不只是箱子而已，数量庞杂的机制中，大部分都可以实现场景的向后切换；而RELICTA中绝大部分情况下场景切换都需要通过把箱子从一个地方移动到另一个地方来完成，这使得游戏多少有点单调，但也不是太大的问题。<br><br>RELICTA已经达到了它该有的高度，无论是谁来说，也不会认为它是解谜游戏的中低下等。甚至更进一步，它与传送门各有优劣，未尝不可一比。但这款游戏无论是玩家数量还是销量上都非常惨淡，冷门到不能再冷门，怎么想都是发行商的错，发行商出来挨打。<br><br>			</div>

																Quite annoying dialogues which deterred me from the game itself. Puzzle stages lack some music or sound to listen into when you're thinking over the solutions. Puzzles are fine and in some cases challenging but it couldn't keep me interested for too long.			</div>

																<div class="bb_h1">Достойный наследник The Talos Principle в мире физических пазлов от французской инди-компании...</div><br>Relicta представляет собой довольно приличный набор головоломок, основанных на физике, использующих силы гравитации и магнетизма.

</a><br><br>Достоинствами игры безусловно является просто шикарная для игр такого уровня графика, довольно каверзные местами, хорошо проработанные головоломки, наличие бесплатных длц, расширяющих набор головоломок еще больше.<br>К минусам я бы отнес пустоту и статичность игрового мира, наличие большого количества забагованных ачивок, которые невозможно на данный момент получить, редкое пропадание музыки во время игры (она просто перестает играть до перезагрузки).<br>Отметил бы еще забагованность некоторых головоломок, но тут меня всегда спасал банальный перезапуск головоломки сначала...			</div>

																Beautiful game, interesting world and setting (the story is simple, but it's good enough to carry the main story thread that gets told through dialogue and data collectibles), lots of puzzles to dig into. Dialogue could sometimes be written a bit better but the voice delivery is good. <br>Production values are great, the world is really well done and each biome feels unique and interesting. The art style is nice and fits the game well, the execution is great. The game also runs really well for how good it looks.<br><br>The puzzles are based on interesting fun concepts but start out way too easy (which is fine as an intro/tutorial, but it stays that way for quite a while). <br>Later instead of increasing the trickiness and difficulty of the solutions and making you think harder the game makes the puzzle areas convoluted and less intuitive instead, which is a shame because the underlying concepts are great.<br><br>It shifts the focus from logically thinking about the solution based on what you can see to wandering around in a big messy puzzle area trying (sometimes unpredictable) things until you find the right steps.   <br>Which would be fine if you could just repeatedly try things, but it can get your cube stuck and unretrievable and make you restart the entire puzzle area, including big chunks of the old steps you have already solved, which is quite annoying.<br>In some cases you can't even try to save it by playing with gravity and polarization (which would actually be fun) because the cube will be stuck behind barriers. <br><br>On the bright side the physics are usually quite predictable and you can really focus on what you want to achieve instead of worrying about it glitching out. Thumbs up for that. <br><br>In short, the puzzles could (and should) be harder and trickier but more readable and logic focussed which would add more challenge and take away frustration and randomness. It's not too bad and it's still fun to progress and find solutions, but it could be even better.<br>In all other aspects the game is absolutely great.<br>			</div>

																Main Story took me near 17 hours to finish. Unsure if it has also counted the times i had left the game running in the background(Probably). Personally thinking at least several stages took me a while to finish and a few to redo.<br><br>Its a First Person Puzzle, the likes of the Witness, Portal and Turing Test. Although it uses some boxes like Talos Principle. I can assure you that it uses different mechanic from all the other games i have played and mentioned. I am also glad it has a story like Turing test.<br><br>Most of the puzzles are more like gradual progression per stage. Not like The Witness where you solve one puzzle with nore lation to the next one.  When reaching the halfway of the story, there will be longer puzzles per stage and you will take time to understand some puzzles starting point first before proceeding. <br><br>There is usually just one way to finish a stage but there are some instances where i solved it skipping a step. Not ideal since i was only making it harder for myself lol. Also leads to a tendency to get stuck resolving it via other ways<br><br>Pos<br>- Decent Story and some lore kinda like Turing Test<br>- Good use of puzzle mechanics<br>- Has some VA (but...)<br><br>Needs improvement<br>- There are a lot of F words for some reason. And this is not really normal(or i would think not normal) for scientists			</div>

																Play this only if you want a lot of puzzles and don't need a story. Pretty graphics though!<br><br>The story segments are way too sparse and too uninteresting to keep playing for them, but if you want to witness the possibly worst death lamentation scene I've ever seen, be my guest.<br>Put on a podcast or a video instead of listening to the dialogue written with a constant sass level so high that it makes you think you're reading a political twitter thread. Though that feeling suddenly likes to flip-flop, becoming dramatic at times and then venturing into (intended) comedy, which is pretty strange.<br><br>The puzzles play well and while they're complex, they're actually pretty straightforward - I didn't have to use a walkthrough a single time which is very uncommon (yeah I'm bad at vidya). And again - there are a lot of puzzles, and there are even more after you finish the game. Probably the best puzzle/price ratio out there.<br><br>If you're interested in more story focus (and frankly, a better story) and fewer puzzles, get The Turing Test or The Spectrum Retreat instead. Maybe even QUBE 1 &amp; 2.			</div>

																I wanted to give this game a good go. Even though the characters were irritating. For being mature (at least middle age) scientists/professionals, they sure were catty and hostile toward each other. Very tiresome. The story seemed rather generic but I was curious how it was going to play out.<br><br>The world between the puzzles is just too big. Big for the sake of being big. Everything looking alike and very little to indicate what direction you should be going. All so that some collectibles can be scattered around. The lore pieces you pick up could have been interesting. But I found the text in the PDA to be difficult to read and stopped bothering.<br><br>But I finally had to stop due to the puzzle game play. Even when performing the puzzles correctly (confirming with YouTube videos), I would run into occasional issues of a box not flying correctly or not being able to jump from the box to the intended landing. Causing me to have to repeat the steps multiple times before I could proceed. The final straw was the end of the Cliff Track. A box kept getting blocked by a green screen. The type of screen the boxes are intended to pass through. Leaving me completely unable to complete the puzzle and proceed.			</div>

																<div class="bb_h1">Schwerer als Raketenwissenschaft </div><br>Phsyikpuzzles mit Würfeln…wo habe ich das nur schonmal gesehen…?<br><br><b>Gameplay</b><br>“Relicta” ist ein First-Person Rätselsspiel, dass vom Prinzip her viele Spieler direkt an <a class="bb_link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/400/Portal/" target="_blank" rel="">Portal</a> erinnern dürfte. In kleinen Bereichen müssen wir abstrakte Rätsel lösen, die oft mit Würfeln zu tun haben. Allerdings haben wir keine Portalkanone, sondern Gravitationshandschuhe, mit denen wir Würfel und Wandmagneten Rot oder Blau polen dürfen und die Schwerkraft für die Würfel aufheben dürfen. Das Prinzip dürfte klar sein: Pack ich einen roten Würfel in die Nähe eines blauen Magneten, wird dieser an die Plattform gezogen. Packe ich einen blauen Würfel in die Nähe eines blauen Magneten oder eines anderen blauen Würfels, stoßen sich diese voneinander ab. Was sich auf dem Papier einfach anhört, ist im Spiel aber gar nicht so leicht. Die Rätsel sind nämlich teilweise verdammt schwer und knackig, denn auch verschiedene Barrieren, Würfelteleporter und weitere Dinge kommen noch hinzu, die das Spiel echt komplex machen. Manchmal sind die Lösungen alles Andere als offensichtlich, manchmal kann man auch ein wenig “schummeln”. Den Schwierigkeitsgrad würde ich auf jeden Fall als hoch einstufen, manchmal klappt die Lösung aber auch einfach nicht, weil das Spiel nicht immer passgenau funktioniert. Und einen echten Kritkpunkt habe ich: Man kann sich viel zu leicht softlocken und muss das gesamte Rätsel eventuell neustarten. Das hat bei mir dann doch immer wieder mal für einigen Frust gesorgt.<br><br><b>Story</b><br>In der Zukunft geht es der Erde nicht mehr so gut und es hat sich eine Art Nation im Orbit und auf dem Mond gebildet. Auf einer abgelegenen und alten Polstation auf dem Mond forschen Protagonistin Angela Patel und ihre Kollegen an verschiedenen Projekten wie etwa den erwähnten Gravitationshandschuhen. Allerdings hat das Team auch etwas gefunden, was nur als “Relicta” bezeichnet wird und von dem kleinem Team geheim gehalten wird. Obendrauf gerät auch noch alles aus dem Ruder und Angelas Tochter muss natürlich gerade zu diesem Zeitpunkt ankommen, um ihrer Mutter bei ihren Forschungen assistieren zu wollen…<br>Die Geschichte ist alleine wegen der Neugier interessant, was dieses Artefakt ist. Aber auch mit unserer Protagonistin, die ständig mit der KI der Station redet, scheint irgendetwas zu passieren. Es könnte zwar manchmal etwas spannender erzählt werden, aber die Geschichte ist in Ordnung als Entschuldigung für die Rätsellösung. Luft nach oben wäre hier aber trotzdem. Wem eher die knackigen Rätsel interessieren, kann die Geschichte auch ganz gut ignorieren.<br><br><b>Grafik/Sound</b><br>Das Spiel ist zwar von einem kleinen Team, aber dass hat keine schlechte Arbeit geleistet. Es ist zwar auch nichts Besonderes, aber die Idee, dass die Forschungssationen verschiedene Biossphären hat, ist schon ganz nett gestaltet. <br><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2965267244" class="dynamiclink_box modalContentLink  ugc" data-modal-content-sizetofit="true" data-appid="941570" data-publishedfileid="2965267244">

</a><br>Manche Elemente wiederholen sich etwas oft, aber insgesamt ist es durchaus gut gemacht. Der Soundtrack spielt kaum eine Rolle und die rein englischen Synchronsprecher machen überwiegend einen guten Job.<br><br><b>DLCs</b><br>Beide DLCs sind direkt enthalten und im Grunde zwei „kurze“ Kampagnen, die nochmal viele knifflige Rätsel mitbringen und jeweils eher wenig Geschichte haben. Insgesamt sind die fast so lang wie das Hauptspiel, bestehen aber aus sehr wenigen Rätseln. Mir waren die einzelnen „Testkammern“ viel zu lang und leider besteht auch wie im Hauptspiel das Problem, dass man sich softlocken kann. Beim zweiten Extra hatte ich dann einfach keine Lust mehr, nachdem mir dies zum wiederholten Mal passiert ist.<br><br><b>Fazit</b><br>„Relicta“ ist ein echt schweres Rätselspiel, bei dem die Lösung oft nicht auf der Hand liegt. Ich bin ehrlich: Ich habe öfters mal einen Walktrough angeschaut, weil es manchmal dann doch frustrieren kann. Ich bin doch wirklich nicht auf den Kopf gefallen…oder? Auch wenn man manchmal mogeln und manche Rätsel lösen kann, wie sie vermutlich nicht in der Intention der Entwickler liegen, ist „Relicta“ eines der kniffligsten Rätselspiele, die ich in den letzten Jahren auf meinem Bildschirm hatte. Abzüge gibt es aber, weil die Physik des Spiels nicht optimal ist und grade die Extrakapitel nicht so schön sind. Auch die Geschichte ist leider sehr dünn. Wer abstrakte Rätsel wie auch in <a class="bb_link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/941570/Relicta/" target="_blank" rel="">Portal</a> mag, wird aber trotzdem seinen Spaß haben, sollte aber gleichzeitig auch vor dem Rätselniveau gewarnt sein!<br><br><br>Weniger rätselhaft, dafür aber voll mit Inhalt ist auch meine <a class="bb_link" href="http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Drakeschool" target="_blank" rel=""> Steamgruppe</a>, in der ich meine Reviews veröffentliche.

																I enjoyed this game. It has its weak spots for sure, but overall I think it's a good first-person puzzler that's worth your time if you enjoy games such as The Talos Principle, Portal, Qube 2, etc.<br><br>If I had to describe it all in one word, it'd be... sprawling. The puzzle areas are very large and cover a lot of ground. It can be a little overwhelming at first. I often needed to do a little recon/exploration before I even started solving anything. <br><br>The puzzles mainly involve manipulating magnetic blocks, hitting switches, moving platforms around, wrangling forcefields, and taking advantage of various gravity and momentum tricks. You'll need to pay attention to how things are connected via their power cables, as this will outline your prerequisites for toggling stuff. <br><br>I thought the level designs were well-suited for the types of mechanics involved, and nothing felt unfair or overly awkward. You can reason your way through most sections by working backwards, so trial-and-error does not play an overly large role unless you're choosing to wing it.<br><br>That being said, your FPS setting may impact physics. Like others have suggested, switching to 60 FPS is a good idea. Sometimes things don't behave correctly otherwise, even at 144 FPS.<br><br>Visually, I thought the game was very colorful and pleasing to look at. I liked that the biomes all had different climates, which helped add a lot of variety and visual distinction to the puzzle environments. <br><br>The two DLC chapters are harder than the main campaign, and they're included for free. However, based on the Steam achievement stats, maybe &lt;= 4% of players even start the DLC - which is unfortunate, as I think those puzzles are a lot stronger in their design. It's a bummer they don't get more visibility. <br><br>At the same time, it's understandable. The main campaign is very fatiguing as it is. The glacier stage midway through the game is particularly long and exhausting. I was running on fumes after that one, and yet there were three whole biomes to tackle afterwards. <br><br>I think the VAs do a good job with what they are given, but the dialogue itself is often awkward, immature, and cringey. And everyone curses... a lot. The story is neat conceptually, but it seems to have a hard time deciding whether it wants to be serious or silly. It's also supposed to take place in the year 2120... anachronistic internet humor as "new phone who this" doesn't really fit. It would be like developing a game in the year 2000 that takes place in the year 2100 where people are still cracking Whassup jokes or something.<br><br>There are in-game collectibles - but none of them are actually found within the puzzle areas, which is a missed opportunity, in my opinion. Instead, the collectibles are often in plain sight, scattered throughout the base station that you return to between biomes. Each collectible gives you some lore that you can read in your PDA, but most of it is pretty meh. <br><br>In general, the base station is too large - it's mostly window dressing with lots of cloned assets and nothing to do. It takes a while to navigate, and it becomes tedious with all the maglev schlepping. <br><br>Most of the Steam achievements come naturally by completing puzzles and picking up collectibles. Past that, there's a speedrun achievement for the main campaign, which is very generous (6 hours) if you've already played the game once and know what to expect. I went at a leisurely pace, and my second playthrough came in around 3 hours and 40 minutes with plenty of mistakes and a few resets. There's no visible timer in-game as far as I can tell, but you can safely pause or quit if you need to take a break.<br><br>In the end, I thought this game was decent -- not bad, not amazing, but somewhere in between. Still quite fun!			</div>

																Relicta is a first person puzzle game which, for me, really scratches the Portal itch. You are constantly thinking about where you need to place your boxes and how to traverse the environment. Aside from this the visuals are very enjoyable and the game runs great. The story to this game is a nice addition but nothing special. <br><br>Overall the game is enjoyable to play because the puzzels are well thought out and are placed in awesome environments. I reccomend playing this game very much if you like portal and/or the talos principle.			</div>

																I find Relicta to be an extremely fine first person puzzle game. It definitely draws from games such as Portal 2, The Talos Principle or Q.U.B.E but has unique puzzle mechanics.<br><br>Basically you have to move cubes around and place them on 'buttons' in order to proceed and finish each test. That is done to a great part by using your gloves which can apply a positive or a negative polarity to cubes. Although that sounds very simple there is a vast array of using these manipulations for a certain outcome. What makes Relicta stand out among the multitude of FPP games is that puzzle areas are vast and require a particular understanding of which intermediate goal can be, and has to be, achieved in what order. I thoroughly enjoyed "reading" the environment and making my conclusions as to what I should do next.<br><br>As to the visuals, Relicta certainly is a beautiful game but save for regular radio communication you are alone and the lunar station the game plays in feels sort of empty but that is a minor gripe. The voice acting is good but be cautioned that there is a lot of strong language if you are sensitive to that sort of thing.<br><br>Lately, two bonus campaigns have been added for free which almost doubles the content of Relicta so it is a definitve recommentation from me. Expecially considering that it is on sale for another two days and costs only 10 €. Go and get it!			</div>

																I wanted to like Relicta. I truly did. I kept playing a little more, thinking "It'll hook me eventually." And it never did, I'm afraid.  I went in expecting something similar to Portal... that's what I was hoping for anyways, but I didn't get that. The story didn't intrigue me. There was nothing really piquing my curiosity to push me forward or motivate me to solve the next puzzle. I didn't really feel invested in this character or the world that they were presenting. The "invisible walls" made it feel artificial.  The story was not engaging and the puzzles didn't require any sort of creativity. After about the 10 hour mark, I went ahead to and turned it off. <br><br>That's not to say that this game is all bad. It has a few positives in its favor. The setting was cool. If you like immersing yourself in science fiction, Relicta certainly delivers that. The gameplay is fair.. there's nothing wrong with it mechanically speaking. The visuals are nice.  It just left me wanting something a little more.... engaging.<br><br>It wasn't for me, but that's just one guy's opinion.			</div>

																I would love to give this a thumbs up but can not. I wish Steam would bring back the 5 star system they used to have for games like this. This game fails, but only just and if no one reads this review all they are going to see is a thumbs down.<br> <br>This game runs beautifully, and the visuals are quite good. The puzzles are challenging without being overly so. The story was decent even if the voice acting was not all that good. Not terrible, but not good either. Where this game fails is the cludgey game play. It's a poorly done platformer, with invisible walls all over the place, the inability to crouch, and jumping not always being allowed. There were many times where I figured out the puzzle almost immediately, but because of the weak controls, simply could not execute. Especially any time were were required to ride a cube. This was extremely annoying. As such I can't  give it a thumbs up. <br>This is fixable with a bit tweaking to the jump and your players ability to stay on a cube they are riding. A bit more traction is needed.  I may revisit this title if they update it. <br> <br>			</div>

																The puzzles themselves were ok, it was sometimes ultra easy and sometimes you didn't realize there was a mag plate somewhere or a box was up on a cliff and when you finally see it you're like ohhhhhhhh there is a pad/box in that spot that i didn't even know existed.  Then once you realize there was this item you didn't see you realize the puzzle wasn't hard it just took you forever to see the one item was there.  <br><br>But i would have just not given an upvote or downvote cause it was a decent puzzle if it was just the gameplay.<br><br>But the story was so so so bad.  It's like in the distant future the dumbest scientists ever are on the moon working haphazardly, recklessly, and arrogantly with the most advanced freaky alien relic ever.  Like imagine the team that developed the nuke but instead they all talked and acted like love island characters.  Literally every time the main character talked i got more upset, it just kept building until i was furious and was hoping either the main character actually had no child ever or the child had been dead the whole time.  <span class="bb_spoiler"><span>Instead at the end you ditch your ex-husband to run off with the alien relic to go off into deep space with it and your child because... I guess your ex is just that bad?  That is literally the end story is your ex is so bad you'd rather just leave humanity to go hang out with an alien that killed your girlfriend accidentally.</span></span>  So after the final cut-scene i was like omg this story is so unbelievably bad i have to go write a negative review just to ♥♥♥♥♥ about this story writing.			</div>

																I enjoy puzzle game so I made it to the end of Relicta but I have nothing good to say about this game, which is disappointing because it looked like it had so much potential. Relicta has so much timing and platforming it is borderline a puzzle platformer which did not play well when it should have just been a puzzle game. By the halfway point the puzzles just get more convoluted and bloated with interference instead of intellectually satisfying to play and beat; after finishing a level I frequently let out a groan for how frustrating it was instead of feeling accomplished. Relicta would have been good if they just made a puzzle game instead of trying to imitate Portal so much, especially when it comes to making "funny" dialogue.<br><br>The loud raven caw as the very first sound when opening the game is a rookie mistake... we are about 20 years past when that should have been fixed.<br><br>Some say the story is functionable but in my opinion is it actively bad and detracts from the game. The dialogue between all characters bounces between tense+dramatic to flirty+playful even between the main character and the main antagonist. Personal qualm about the story teaser at the start, I hate when media starts off showing an exciting hook and then you play through the exact same sequence later in the game like I've already seen this five minute you showed me earlier, don't make me play it again, just don't do the cheesy *record scratch* "You're probably wondering how I got into this situation, lets start from the beginning"<br><br>The interstitials between puzzle zones definitely need a map or waypoint indicators because each time you are dropped in a large facility with no way of knowing where to go and several dead ends, and what you are looking for is a small panel that is not lit up on a console that looks like several others. There is even a PDA that has your current goal that would the the perfect place for a map, but it only has emails and lore documents.... It's so bad that I had to look up a video walkthrough JUST to get to the next area because I was so lost.<br><br>A big issue for me personally is the lack of colorblind mode, which is a problem when they have overlapping laser grid walls whose color is supposed to tell you what can and can't pass through, and a switch changes a far away gate from green(?) to red(?) when a colorblind mode could easily put a pattern up to replace the dot pattern on each gate.... The game is full of oversights like this.<br><br>My biggest issue overall is that the main challenge of each puzzle is the intentional obfuscation of puzzle elements. The goal to each puzzle does not have any wires or indicator of what button to press to solve it, so all you know is a wall is blocking what could be the exit and something somewhere lets you go past it. On more than half the puzzles in the first zone I did not notice a box in a corner or behind a wall, and there is nothing pointing to it. The puzzles themselves are not that great which might be why they have to pad with the annoying additions of finding the pieces or platforming fillers. In the final zone you have to spot a key part of a puzzle through literal cracks in the floorboards. In that same puzzle trajectory puzzle was done correctly but got stuck on visual shrubbery and makes it seem like the wrong path because of the colored walls. All the stages have too many visual barriers and separated chambers so you can't get a good idea of what there is, leading to much running around just to get a feel of where you are each and every stage. This puzzle design just chains multiple separate puzzles together that could have easily been separate stages but they are mixed together just for the sake of confusion, like having 4 sudoku grids adjacent to each other just to make it seem like a bigger puzzle.<br><br>Even early in the game a mechanic has to be used in a non-intuitive way. Several times they introduce a mechanic in one puzzle and the very next puzzle you use it differently. That pacing is just too frantic, at least think of a second puzzle using the mechanics the first way you introduced before forcing a creative and obscured solution. There is just way too much platforming and timing in this game that is intentionally designed for your to fail the first time. The second real puzzle of the whole game relies on timing, by moving your character over pressure plates you aren't looking at and don't snap to, and then grabbing the box in mid air as it flies by or else you have to repeat the process.<br>There are several more timing ones and even others where you intentionally have to not lock the cube into the pressure plate and leave it floating to line up a shot that might go where you think it should and might not. When new puzzle elements are added there are zero prompts or tutorials on how to use them, which would be fine if the learn-as-you-play style of Baba is You starts you off slow but Relicta just keeps the same cluster of random puzzles and throws in a new one and says have fun figure it out.<br><br>The visuals are nice enough I guess, but for a 26GB game it really should look a lot better.. even the moisture pattern on the screen (the character is wearing a helmet?) does not change and there is a big streak slightly above the crosshairs that catches the light and is annoying for the whole game once you notice it.<br><br>The cherry on top is how each time you get an achievement you get a second one right after the cutscene. Why doubled up achievements? Really lame and makes no sense.			</div>

</a><br><b>Geschichte</b><br><br>Die Geschichte ist eher nebensächlich. Wir befinden uns wohl auf einem terrageformeten Mond (der aber aussieht, als hätte man einen Landschaftpark aus unterschiedlichsten Gegenden der Erde zusammengetragen), irgendwas liegt im argen und wir diskutieren mit einer "freundlichen" KI, während wir Puzzles lösen.<br><br>Das klingt nach einem schwachen Abklatsch von Portal und das ist es auch (auch wenn man sich etwas Mühe gegeben hat). An sich nette Dialoge, kommt es nie und nimmer an die amüsante Dramatik von Portal oder an die philosophische Tiefe von Talos heran.<br><br><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2760506307" class="dynamiclink_box modalContentLink  ugc" data-modal-content-sizetofit="true" data-appid="941570" data-publishedfileid="2760506307">

</a><br><b>Gameplay</b><br><br>Es ist also, wenn man von den sehr langen Laufwegen im Hub absieht, ein reines Rätselspiel, bei dem man Testkammer für Testkammer lösen muss, wie man es vom klassischen Teil von Portal kennt.<br><br>Die Level sehen hingegen eher aus wie in Talos. Der Ausgang ist immer eine "Energiewand", deren Sperre aufgehoben wird, indem ein oder mehrere Druckplatten mit einem Würfel beschwert werden.<br><br>Wir können diese Kuben mit magnetischen Kräften anziehen, abstoßen und schweben lassen. Die weiteren Funktionalitäten werden Schritt für Schritt meist mit einem einfachen Level eingeführt, so dass diese recht verständlich sind. So gibt es unterschiedlich farbige Energiewände, Schalter, Magnetpunkte und Teleporter.<br><br>Soweit ich sehe, gibt es im wesentlichen zwei Meinungen zu den gebotenen Rätseln und irgendwie haben beide recht. Einerseits: Die Rätsel wiederholen sich im wesentlichen, auch wenn sie oft sehr umfangreich sind. Andererseits: Jedes Rätsel ist eine neue Herausforderung, da man sich immer erst orientieren muss und es oft nicht einfach ist zu erkennen, wie was diesmal zu tun ist.<br><br>In dieser Mischung kann es auf Dauer anstrengend werden, sich immer wieder hineinzuknien in das nächste Rätsel. Ob es Spaß macht oder nicht hängt wohl davon ab, wie schwer es einem fällt oder wie sehr man das liebt.<br><br>Probleme entstehen (und insofern lassen sie indirekt erkennen, wie gut insbesondere Portal entworfen ist), wenn gewisse Abkürzungen möglich sind oder man nicht mehr weiterkommen kann (das Wort softlock habe ich hier gelernt). Das passiert nicht ständig, aber wenn, dann fällt es auf.<br><br>Bei den großen Leveln fehlen vielleicht Checkpoints (nach meinem Geschmack), die auch eine Rückmeldung sind, dass man etwas richtig gemacht hat.<br><br>Aber das Problem, wo ich scheiterte, war einer der Momente, in denen es auf Timing ankommt, also Schnelligkeit und dabei zielgenaues ausführen hintereinanderliegernder Handlungen. Es kommen Timer und vor allem Wächter, ähnlich wie in Talos, und man muss bestimmte Zeitpunkte abpassen und dann alles richtig machen. Da wird aus einem Denkspiel auch noch ein Geschicklichkeitsspiel. Etwa in der Mitte des Spieles kam ich nicht weiter. Das war m.E. aber auch diesbezüglich die schwerste Stelle, danach konzentriert sich das Gaming wieder auf komplex werdende Knobelaufgaben.<br><br><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2760507539" class="dynamiclink_box modalContentLink  ugc" data-modal-content-sizetofit="true" data-appid="941570" data-publishedfileid="2760507539">

</a><br><b>Technik</b><br><br>Die Grafik ist super. Sowohl innen wie außen ist die Umgebung eindrucksvoll. Der Stil eines modernen SciFi-Abenteuers einschließlich passender Schrift ist klasse. Dass es künstliche Wände gibt ist auch gut "erklärt", es wirkt wie unsichtbare Energiewände, die aufleuchten, wenn man sie berührt. Auf Personen hat man verzichtet, man spielt in einer menschenleeren Umgebung in First Person.<br><br>Der Sound ist gut. Die Gespräche werden auf Englisch geführt, sind aber nicht wirklich wichtig.<br><br>Die Steuerung mit Controller ist gut. Wenn es auf Schnelligkeit un Genauigkeit ankommt, habe ich aber lieber mit Tastatur/Maus gespielt, was ebenfalls gut klappt.<br><br><b>Sonstiges</b><br><br>Ich habe etwa 11h gespielt, bis ich nicht mehr weiter kam (etwa die Hälfte des Spiels).<br><br>Die Errungenschaften erfordern neben dem Lösen der Rätsel ein paar optionale Dinge.<br><br><div class="bb_code"><b>In Zahlen für mich persönlich ein Unterhaltungswert von 6/10.</b></div><br>Ein anspruchvoller, evtl. leicht repetitiv anstrengender Portal-Talos-Klon. Mindestens ein Timing-Element war mir allerdings zu schwer.<br><br>Empfehlen oder nicht? Ich konnte es nicht durchspielen und es kommt nicht an die großen Vorbilder heran, aber die Rätsel waren interessant bis fordernd, hat also auch Spaß gemacht. Insgesamt also eine Empfehlung mit den genannten Vorbehalten.<br><br><hr><br><i>Dies ist mein subjektiver Spieleindruck. Für meine Wertung zählt, wie gut es mich unterhalten hat. Entsprechend der Daumen nach oben oder unten, abhängig davon, ob ich es einem ähnlich gesinnten Spieler weiterempfehle. Der Spieleindruck eines anderen Spielers kann aber durchaus stark davon abweichen.</i>			</div>

																자기력과 중력을 이용한 물리 퍼즐들이 주를 이루는 게임이라고 설명에 써있긴 한데, 실제로는 이것보다 조금 더 복잡하다. 관성이나 운동량도 생각하면서 플레이 해야 한다. 물론 게임이다보니 수식으로 계산을 해야 하고 그럴 정도는 아니다.<br><br> 퍼즐을 푸는 과정은 탈로스의 법칙과 꽤 유사하다. 구역을 뛰댕기면서 오브젝트를 찾아서 적당한 위치에 두는 식으로 플레이한다.<br>물리적 트릭을 통해 풀어야 하는 퍼즐이 많고 퍼즐 자체의 난이도들도 꽤 있어서 이런 3d 퍼즐게임들을 좋아했다면 꽤 재밌게 플레이 할 수 있을 것이다. 퍼즐의 갯수도 60여개쯤 되는데, 대신 퍼즐 하나 하나의 길이가 꽤 길어서 플레이타임은 빠르게 푼다면 10~15시간 정도 될 것이다. 한글화도 매우 잘 되어 있어 플레이 하는데 지장이 없을 것이다.<br><br> 다만, 단점이 좀 많이 보인다.<br><br>- 게임이 매우 직선적이다. 특별히 자유도는 존재하지 않고, 미션이 가라는 데가 아니면 갈 수조차 없다. 여기까지면 단점이 아닐 수도 있는데, 심지어 엔딩을 보고 나서도 한번 푼 퍼즐을 다시 풀 수 없다. 세이브 데이터도 하나밖에 지원하지 않는 것 같아서 처음부터 다시 깨야 하는 것 같다... 수집템도 100% 하려면 다시 해야 하는 것 같다.<br><br>- 처음부터 난이도가 꽤 있는데, 이 난이도가 처음부터 끝까지 거의 일정하다. 나는 마지막 퍼즐이 풀면서 마지막인지도 몰랐다..<br>이 점이 위의 직선적이라는 점과 맞물려 게임이 지루하다라는 생각마저 들게 한다. 스테이지가 진행될수록 사용하는 오브젝트의 수만 늘어나고 게임의 난이도 자체는 크게 바뀌지 않는다.<br><br>- 이 게임은 퍼즐을 푸는 구역도 엄청 넓고 오브젝트의 종류와 양이 많다. 벽만 해도 사람만 통과할 수 있는 벽, 큐브만 통과할 수 있는 벽, 둘 다 통과할수 없는 벽, 드론만 통과할 수 없는 벽 등 다양하다. 길이만 길고 푸는 방법은 쉬운 퍼즐들도 꽤 많은데, 이런 퍼즐들은 푸는 것 자체보다 지역이 너무 넓고 오브젝트도 너무 많아서 어디부터 풀어야 할 지 모르겠어서 시간이 오래 걸렸다. 이렇게 퍼즐의 규모가 컸어도 앞에서 작동시킨 오브젝트가 뒤에서도 쓰이는 식으로 활용되는 요소가 있다면 오히려 레벨 디자인에 감탄했을 것이다. 하지만, 이 게임은 한번 쓰인 오브젝트가 다시는 안 쓰이는 경우가 너무나도 많았다. 퍼즐 하나를 모두 깨야 자동 저장이 되는 시스템도 이 점 때문에 불편했다.<br><br>- 뚜렷한 스토리가 있고 이 스토리라인대로 진행되는데, 스토리가 용두사미로 끝났다는 느낌을 지울 수가 없었다..<br><br>- 퍼즐 구역을 이동하기 위해 연구소를 뛰어다니게 되는데, 이 부분에선 뛰어댕기는 거랑 수집품 모으는 거 말곤 할 게 없다. 명색이 연구소인데 사람도 아무도 없고, 딱히 인터렉션을 할 만한 요소도 아무것도 없고 그냥 워킹 시뮬레이션이다. 이 부분은 없어도 게임 진행엔 지장이 없을 정도였다.<br><br>- 물리 법칙을 활용하는 게임이다 보니 물리 엔진 관련해서 버그도 있고 버그성 플레이로 넘길 수 있는 곳도 몇 군데 있다. 물론 이건 게임 특성상 어쩔수 없긴 하다.<br><br>'퍼즐'로서는 재미있었는데, '퍼즐 게임'으로서는 많이 아쉬웠다. 나는 이 게임이 잘 만든 것도 아니고 못 만든 것도 아닌 중간이라고 생각하지만 스팀에 평가가 추천이랑 비추천 두개밖에 없어서 일단은 추천을 넣었다. 퍼즐 게임을 좋아하고 50% 이상 세일일 때 사는 걸 추천한다.<br><br>			</div>

																While I do liked the game in the beginning, some time afterwards the riddles start to become very tedious. The just get bigger and bigger. Then you just run around trying things just to find out where you are going.<br>In the last part, I thought that the puzzles started to deviate sometimes from the logic of the game so far.<br><br>The story is not that great, but not a let down. You can give it a go but do not expect a Portal or a The Turing test. As another suggested, it become a chore near the end, and I as well started to play the puzzles in breaks. <br><br>A way point would be also appreciated. If you are at the 3rd part of the puzzle and you leave, you go back to the beginning.			</div>

																<b> Après avoir fait réfléchir des nombreux joueurs pendant sa démo. Relicta, le puzzle game développé par Mighty Polygon, et édité par Ravnscourt, est enfin disponible. <br>Ce jeu d'énigmes basées sur la physique, en utilisant le magnétisme et la gravité, nous envoie sur la base lunaire Chandra, où une équipe de scientifiques explorer les différents écosystèmes à travers des dômes géants. Mais le plus grand secret qui se cache sur cette base, c'est le Relicta. D'ailleurs, on a fait un petit voyage dans le temps, histoire de l’étudier nous aussi. On a écrit quelques notes à son sujet. On a surtout passé des heures à résoudre les nombreuses énigmes du jeu, pour vous offrir ce test. </b><br><br><a class="bb_link" href="https://youtu.be/3WSDNB6uRpw" target="_blank" rel="">trailer du jeu</a> <br><br><div class="bb_h1">Une histoire de famille.</div><br>Relicta est un jeu d'énigmes, où on y contrôle le docteur Angelica Patel, scientifique de génie, travaillant sur la base Chandra. Alors que les recherches sur les différents écosystèmes de cette base se déroulent sans encombre. La base subit des interférences dues à une espèce de météorite aux lueurs violettes, appelée Relicta. Des scientifiques disparaissent, le système se détraque, et la fille du docteur Patel se trouve bloquée sur une autre navette. Seule face à ce danger, Angelica Patel va devoir traverser les différents dômes de cette base, pour sauver sa fille. Mais surtout, découvrir la vérité sur le Relicta.<br><br>On pourrait croire que Relicta ne soit qu'un simple jeu d'énigmes. Mais le jeu propose une véritable petite histoire derrière. On ne peut pas vous dévoiler son contenu, car cela pourrait gâcher l’expérience des futurs joueurs, qui souhaiteraient se lancer dans l'aventure. L'aventure se déroule toujours de la même manière, on prend le maglev, espèce de petit tramway spatial, pour rejoindre les différents cratères terraformés de la base. Une fois sur place, on prend un ascenseur qui nous envoie directement dans un gigantesque terrain de jeu. Et on résout les énigmes qui nous font face. Au total, il y a 5 cratères à découvrir dans Relicta. <br>Et chacun de ces cratères ont entre 2 et 4 lieux à découvrir. Renfermant chacun de nombreuses énigmes.<br><br>Pour venir à bout de Relicta, il faudra compter une bonne dizaine d'heures de jeu. Mais cela dépendra de votre façon à comprendre et résoudre les énigmes. Les premières sont assez simples. Mais plus on avance dans l'histoire, plus elles se compliquent. Et parfois, il faudra une bonne dose de persévérance, ou de chance, pour les terminer.<br><br><div class="bb_h1">Bleu, Rouge !?</div>Relicta est facile à prendre en main. Notre personnage est équipé d'une paire de gants qui permet de modifier le magnétisme de cubes et de petites plaques carrées. <br>Le but dans chacune des énigmes sera de se frayer un chemin, en déverrouillant la porte qui mène à l’énigme suivante, jusqu'à atteindre l'ascenseur final. Chaque cratère apporte sa petite nouveauté, histoire de rendre les énigmes plus complexes.<br><br>On démarre doucement avec des casse-tête simples. On va devoir gérer le magnétisme des cubes pour les faire se déplacer. Et ainsi déverrouiller le chemin. Dès le début, le jeu intègre aussi la gravité. Ce qui permet aux cubes de s'envoler. Il est même possible de monter dessus pour atteindre des lieux, grâce à la gravité des cubes. Dans Relicta, le magnétisme est représenté par le bleu et le rouge. Le rouge et le bleu s'attirent. Et les couleurs identiques s'éloignent. Et tout au long de l'aventure, les énigmes se basent sur ce système de magnétisme, qui à la longue, devient simple à maîtriser.<br><br>Mais ça serait bien trop simple de ne gérer que le magnétisme des cubes et des plateformes pour progresser dans le jeu. Plus on avance, plus de nouvelles mécaniques s'invitent aux énigmes. Par la suite, on devra aussi gérer d'autres problèmes, comme des portes électromagnétiques qui ne font pas passer les cubes. <br>Mais qui font passer votre corps. Ou d'autres que ne feront passer ni vous, ni les cubes. <br>Il y aura aussi des plateformes mouvantes, des interrupteurs, ou encore des abeilles mécaniques, qui désactivent tous le magnétisme dans leur zone de passage. Et tout commence à se mélanger, devenant un casse-tête encore plus difficile à résoudre.<br><br>Pour tout vous dire, à partir de la dernière heure de jeu, les énigmes sont tellement complexe, et inclus tellement de mécaniques différentes, qu'on peut passer des heures à essayer de trouver la solution. <br>Et après de nombreux échecs, on tente des choses, pour que la chance prenne le dessus. Malheureusement, ça ne fonctionne pas toujours. Et on se retrouve bloqué. On n'y comprend plus rien. On se dit qu'on est mauvais. Pas assez intelligent. On se remet vraiment en question. Puis on remarque qu'un petit cube était caché en haut d'une plateforme. Il attendait son moment de gloire. <br>Et nous, pendant ce temps, on s'acharnait sur des abeilles, qui ne faisaient que leur job.<br><br>Car en plus de proposer des casse-tête de plus en plus difficile, Relicta aime cacher les solutions dans les endroits les moins regardés. Histoire de faire comprendre aux joueurs qu'il faut aussi fouiller un peu partout.<br><br>D'ailleurs, entre chaque zone d’énigmes, on retourne pendant un petit temps dans la base. <br>Et quand on fouille dans les moindres recoins de cette base, on y découvrir des objets qui vont servir de collectibles. Cartes de données. Documents. Ou objets en tous genres. Il y a de nombreux petits collectibles à récupérer. Mais uniquement dans la base lunaire. Histoire de prendre une pause bien méritée, après des heures dans un cratère.<br><br><div class="bb_h1">Un voyage à travers des dômes.</div><br>Notre voyage dans Relicta est peut-être semé d’embûche. Mais il reste inoubliable. Surtout grâce à sa magnifique direction artistique, qui nous fait découvrir 5 écosystèmes totalement différents. <br>Et tellement magnifique. On parcourt des plaines enneigées. Des canyons arides. Des montagnes parsemées d'arbres. Ou encore, une sublime île tropicale. Et tout ceci, en restant dans une seule et même base. On est totalement dépaysé par les différentes zones que propose Relicta. Et surtout, on en prend plein la vue. <br>Déjà que le jeu est magnifique. Tous ces lieux immenses et très détaillés, le rendent encore plus beau. Lors de la démo, on avait déjà découvert la beauté de Relicta. Mais ce n’était qu'une infime partie de ce que nous réservait le jeu.<br><br>Au début, on s'attendait à découvrir un nouveau Q.U.B.E, qui reprend un peu le même style d'énigmes. <br>Mais on ne pensait pas que le jeu serait aussi poussé, et magnifique. Même si les casse-tête ont le don de nous faire bouillir les méninges, l'univers nous offre quelque chose d'apaisant, qui permet de détendre un peu, en observant les magnifiques paysages du jeu. Si vous aimez les points de vue exceptionnels. Relicta vous en offre à foison. Parfois, juste pour le plaisir, on se pose, et on prend des photos de l'environnement. <br>D'ailleurs, il y a même un mode photo intégré, pour se faire un petit plaisir supplémentaire.<br><br>....

																地图设计太烂，尤其在基地里，根本不知道要去哪，难不成找路也是解密的一部分？？？？？？？？从一个基地晃悠半天去到另一个基地，然后发现走错了，然后再返回来接着找，这种类型游戏搞什么沙盒？？？？？？？？？设计者有病吧非要加个基地场景？？然后任务标识也没有，很多游戏销量差是有原因的，设计者总喜欢加些反人类的东西当作创新。还有这个游戏没有手动保存功能，后面的关卡，一个谜题很大，如果没有解完退出下次还要重新玩，恶心至极！			</div>

																先说解密，解密还行，难度适中，也没有什么眼前一亮的设计，比较一般。<br>然后我就要吐槽的就是解密之外的地图设计了，真的蠢，整得还挺大，完全没用，也没个指引，跑来跑去的费了一大堆时间去找地方。你告诉我要去梅苏克（好像是），但是我在中央基地上的地图看也没看到哪个地的英文名读着像的啊，有好些房间和柜子能打开的打开里边也啥都没有，我直接喵喵喵？？？。我是来玩解密游戏的，不是来浪费时间的。			</div>

																Se trata de un juego de puzzles donde deberemos combinar el magnetismo, la gravedad y la polaridad de los campos para completar los puzzles que conforman las distintas fases. Cómo se puede observar, el juego bebe de juegos de puzzles como Qube, Portal o The Talos Principle. No sólo sirven de inspiración para el tratamiento  de los puzzles, sino para contar una historia.<br><br>En un principio, los puzzles serán simples, mover cubos y activar interruptores. Pero conforme avanzamos en el juego, se irán añadiendo nuevas mecánicas y formas de completar los puzzles. Esto hace que la premisa de gravedad, magnetismo y polaridad se vuelva más creativa y nos encontremos volando en un cubo mientras vamos activando campos magnéticos o pulsando pistones, mientras esquivamos robots que nos desactivan la polaridad, para llevar un cubo a través de un mapa hasta su correspondiente botón.<br><br>La dificultad del título no es excesiva, por lo que el progreso de aprendizaje es correcto, aunque si me he encontrado algunos picos dispares de dificultad, donde en una sala el puzzle es muy sencillo y en la siguiente de repente escala bastante su dificultad. Pero no es la tónica habitual.<br><br>Cómo menciono en el primer párrafo, el juego también se inspira en Portal en la forma en la que trata la historia. Aunque no lo realiza de la forma excelente cómo lo hace el título de Valve, las conversaciones entre los personajes son muy divertidas, especialmente ♥♥♥ un personaje que nos recordará a aquellas divertidas conversaciones ♥♥♥ GladOs, y sirven para relajar al jugador tras una sesión de puzzles.<br>Además podremos encontrar distintos coleccionables en forma de documentos que encontraremos por la base lunar mientras vamos de una zona a otra y que podremos consultar en una PDA, que nos enseñarán más cosas del mundo en el que se ambienta Relicta, que es muy interesante. Es de agradecer el esfuerzo en crear una historia en este género, donde no se suele dar mucho.<br><br>En cuanto al apartado gráfico, el juego es muy bonito. Nos hará recorrer bonitos parajes ambientados en distintos biomas desde una tundra a un desierto.  Este último en especial me ha gustado mucho.<br><br>Si hablamos de duración, creo que al juego le sobran unas 3-4 horas. Aunque la realización de puzzles es divertida, llegado a un momento de la historia se siente cómo que el juego se alarga un poco de forma artificial, <span class="bb_spoiler"><span>forzándonos a volver a todos los biomas para volver a realizar más puzzles</span></span>. A mi me ha durado unas 20 horas y quizás hubiera preferido unas 12-15, en mi opinión.<br><br>Cómo otra pega, en algunos puzzles me he sentido que no estaba haciendo lo correcto y los he completado sin saber muy bien cómo al salir volando ♥♥♥ un cubo y acabar en la parte final del puzzle pensando que me he saltado pasos, aunque esta sensación no es muy común, la habré sentido en 3-4 ocasiones.<br><br>En general, el juego me ha gustado mucho. He disfrutado mucho los puzzles y me ha sorprendido la historia, que suele ser banal en este género y me ha parecido divertida y atractiva. Güen trabajo, Mighty Polygon.			</div>

																Se c'è un punto forte di sto gioco sicuramente bisogna menzionare la grafica che vi sbalordirà sicuramente o comunque noterete il fatto che non è blanda. I puzzle sono intuitivi ma non sempre semplici, dovrete riflettere abbastanza. Le manipolazioni per risolvere i puzzle sono di più rispetto a Portal. Comunque gioco che merita sicuramente, ma no vi aspettate uno sparatutto action.			</div>

																"It's so dense. Every single [puzzle] has so many things going on." - Rick McCallum<br><br>The story is phenomenal (so far). The voice acting is great. The writing is pretty funny, I'm very happy that a puzzle game let the scientists say "♥♥♥♥". The environments are beautiful. The puzzles start out pretty neato. Then they stop being pretty neato.<br><br>The puzzles at the beginning of the game are fairly simple and do a good job of conveying puzzle mechanics. Then as puzzle games do, the complexity ramps up. What usually happens is that later puzzles combine concepts in new and interesting ways, and every so often add a new mechanic to permute with all the other things that the player has seen so far. The design of Relicta makes this ramping complexity extremely tedious. I got so fed up with the puzzles that I looked up a complete play-through on YouTube to see how long the game takes. The play-through was 16 hours. Time-wise, I'm only a quarter done with this game, and I'm rapidly approaching the point where I don't want to keep playing.<br><br>In the later levels that happen about one-third of the way through the game, I go to a new room and am overwhelmed by the number of moving parts. I stare at it for 5 minutes, then make one move and get some progress. Then I stare at it for another 10 minutes, and make a second move that gets even more progress. Then I stare at it for 15 more minutes until I solve it. I'm looking at 15-20 different features of the puzzle map and trying to figure out how they can all relate together, or whether they're even related to each other.<br><br>The complexity of all these puzzles would be fine if the process weren't so draining. There's a visual overload that saps my energy as I stare at a physics puzzle and try to figure out how on Terra (to reiterate: story good!) I'm supposed to proceed. Then when I figure it out, I don't get a sense of euphoria at finding a new mechanic. I feel like a third grader learning how to open dial locks for the first time, helplessly toying with the lock on my locker, and feeling a sense of relief when it opens that I don't need to deal with the lock anymore. Rarely in this game do I look back at a puzzle I just did and say "Wow, that was cool!" Instead I remember that the play-through is 16 whole hours and I need to get a move-on if I want to finish the game and spend my time on other things.<br><br>I think if the game were somehow shorter, then I would be more amenable to playing through the whole thing. The plot points should absolutely stay the way they are, but maybe the number of puzzles within each region could be cut down. A lot of energy is required to progress the game to the next major plot point, and I'm busy enough otherwise that I don't have that energy.			</div>

																It's like Portal, except instead of portals, you push blocks.<br><br>It's like The Talos Principle, except instead of philosophical commentary, it's pointless melodramatic dialogue where the "writers" think the height of humor is saying ♥♥♥♥.<br><br>Puzzles start out okay, although not particularly well designed, as you figure out all the gimmicks of the main mechanic. As you can imagine, there are only so many ways to push and pull "magnetic" boxes, and it quickly devolves into long, convoluted puzzles that feel like busy work. <br><br>Honestly I probably would have just uninstalled and not a left a review, but the dialogue made me want to blow my brains out.			</div>

																I can't recommend this game and I made it pretty damn far (only had two more sections of the game to complete) but this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ game is just way too much of a slog. It has some great satisfying puzzles coupled with some stupid boring puzzles. The puzzles in this game also suffer from “Did I do that right?” almost 40-50 percent of the puzzles I completed without using the tools that were obviously put in place to use. On more then one occasion I skipped entire sections of a puzzle segment because I had a “lucky” spin or toss on a block or solved it a different way. It completely feels like you (the player) are breaking the rules of the puzzles but NOT in a good way because you then take those techniques, that you should not be doing, and try to use them in another puzzle segment and it completely throws the flow of the game off. Not only that I had multiple instances of the blocks getting STUCK in the level and there being no way out without resetting the segment, while this may not seem like a big deal the later segments in the game are much longer so a block may get stuck in an unrecoverable area and you are forced to reset THE ENTIRE ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ SEGMENT, this is what put me over the edge in the Forest River area and caused me to quit. The story is also very meh…<br>Pass on this one, even for free.<br><br>Go play Talos, Qube series or the Portal series instead.<br>			</div>

																This game was gifted to me! The concept is great. It reminded me of Portal, but it should NOT be compared to it.<br><br>It just didn't quite hit the spot and the story did get a little confusing in some parts, especially when it would get you worked up for a story arc end or turn and then.... it was just more puzzles. There's bugs that need to be worked out, load times were long, and it just didn't run very smoothing no matter how I adjusted the settings. Puzzle difficulties were inconsistent. Sometimes I got threw in under ten minutes, other times it took me longer. With and without tutorials.<br><br>Don't really recommend this game overall.			</div>

																Puzzle gameplay and graphics are the highlight, though gameplay stops evolving and becomes repetitive around the mid-point. Plot and conversations are embarrassing. Buy maybe if you're a puzzle fanatic and on heavy sale only.<br><br>As far as qube-puzzle-games are concerned, this one quickly becomes challenging, even if you're quite familiar with said games (though not as hardcore as DLC for QUBE2).<br>The only thing that feels off is that you can't throw qubes or drop them while jumping, which is a strange limitation. This first impression lasts a couple hours before stagnating, which makes the game really worth around 2-3 bucks.<br><br>Visuals look great and it runs well even on my potato PC with graphics settings: highest-mid-low-highest-highest-mid-highest (then resolution scale adjustment to get max fps)<br><br>gfx settings are bugged and don't always apply, or sometimes reset. Changing them should be done in the start menu of the game and not while playing.<br><br>Plot is meh. There's some illogical nonsense to make it seem like solving these puzzles is sth important and heavy suspense of disbelief is required, but usually it's not too distracting. <br><br>The most annoying thing is the voice acting. It's obviously a small budget game. But then it just should be less of it. It seems like one single voice actress recorded the lines for almost all characters, with slightly varying pitch and accents. Overuses "f.uck", to seem cool or edgy, but most of the time it's out of place. The humor is corny and unimaginative.<br>There's a ideological propaganda red-flag with them calling themselves "women of science" instead of "scientists". There's enough SJ-filth in games as it is...<br>All of these characters don't sound like scientists in space. Too much swag, too cool, too unrestrained, too confident, too extraverted. They seem more like at a college party than on the moon.			</div>

																This game is currently in the Humble Bundle for May 2021. If you are interested in the game and it's before June 1st, 2021, consider picking up the game as part of the current monthly bundle.<br><br>This is a first-person physics-based puzzler, which means it’s like Portal or Talos Principle, though this time around, the big gimmick is the ability to enable or disable gravity for the blocks as well as magnetize them.<br><br>There’s also a story that Relicta keeps trying to make the player care about.  The concept is fine, but I found myself tuning out after the first hour, I didn’t care about any of the characters, and a few of them felt like they were having vicious mood swings in between each line.  Relicta could have been better off just focusing on the levels which were well designed. <br><br>The puzzles in Relicta are rather solid, and after the first couple of sets, they started to introduce interesting and unique concepts that kept me having to understand the rules for the world.<br><br>Pick this up if you enjoy block puzzle games, though I would say this isn’t as well done as either Talos Principle or Portal.  If you don’t like puzzle games, there’s not much here for you. <br><br>If you enjoyed this review or want to know what I think of other games in the bundle, check out the full review on or subscribe to my youtube channel:<br><br><div class="dynamiclink_box " onclick="DynamicLink_PlayYouTubeVideoInline( this, &quot;77sXJp-pb6M&quot; );">

																In my opinion a very enjoyable, challenging and atmospheric puzzle game with nice story integration.<br>All in all the main game (without DLCs) took me about 33 hours to play through without walkthrough, where I enjoyed almost every minute of it. The game also has it's not so good sides indeed, but 90% of the game I really found joyful.<br><br>So on the good side:<br>+ Great graphics<br>+ Challenging puzzles, but fair and always able to find a way out with logic or "creative" thinking<br>+ Well I would say "nice" story integration, while not perfect and not always logic, it still gives you a part of the game's atmosphere<br>+ Great atmosphere<br>+ The chance for a "dead-lock" situation is very low<br>+ nice sound effects<br><br>The neutral side:<br>o There is some music, but I would not really call it music. But it's okay<br>o Indeed there is much profanity in this game, but that's part of the protagonist's personality, so for me it's okay :)<br><br>The negative side:<br>- There are some few situations where, with bad luck, you really can stuck and have to restart the level<br>- Checkpoint saving ... I personally really did not like that, because it means you have to complete a puzzle before you can save the game .. which in later levels can take more than an hour.. Most time it's not a big loss, as, if you already know how to solve the puzzles, you can usually redo the steps in about 5 minutes, but there are also some puzzle elements which needs accurate moving and/or timing, where it's really annoying if you can not save and have to redo it, if you need to quit the game..<br><br>But all in all I would buy this game again and I even rebought this game for the full price to support the, in my opinion, developer's great work. Thanks for given us that game. Perfect for people seeking out for more after Talos Principle or Portal :) It's not the same .. sure! .. it's not that perfect .. also sure! .. but it's still totally worth buying and playing :)			</div>

																This game lost my trust almost right away after I beat a couple puzzles in ways that made me unsure if I actually understood the mechanics or if just broke the puzzle. There's no satisfaction in bypassing a puzzle if you aren't sure if you "solved" it. May as well throw out puzzle pieces and cut out the picture on the box. Not why I play puzzle games.			</div>

																Podobný systém jako v Portal - kombinace příběhu a logické hry, která postrádá prvky, které by přitáhly a udržely pozornost - zábavu a zajímavý příběh.<br>Grafika je hezká, hra je dobře namluvená a hádanky jsou mnohdy zapeklité a velice dobře sestavené. Tím asi pozitiva končí.<br>Ve hře nejsou žádná NPC - celá základna, která vypadá, jakoby ji měly obývat desítky/stovky lidí, je naprosto prázdná, prostředí je nezajímavé a postrádá smysl, proč by mělo ve světě existovat. Základní mechaniky logických hádanek jsou jednoduché a po několika hodinách začnou velice nudit.<br>Nakonec jsem si po 3 hodinách řekl, proč to vlastně hraju? A nedokázal si odpovědět. Proto jsem ani nepokračoval.			</div>

																Attenzione: potrebbe contenere spoiler (se il gioco avesse una trama).<br>Nelle puntate precedenti: abbiamo la dottoressa Angelica Patel, mamma di Kira e ex moglie di un certo Ragnar Nguien. Perchè in Relicta è tutto rose e fiori: i personaggi hanno nomi e cognomi ♥♥♥ latitudini incompatibili, la nave si chiama Solidaridad, perchè War of Destruction whit Blood and Proud Cazzi e Mazzi nel  2021 non è accettabile che siamo tutti corretti e il computer di bordo si chiama Sys anche se ha una voce da uomo perchè sempre nel 2021 i pronomi sono sostiuiti da un * e Bro non è femminista. Relicta poi ci insegna ad amare il prossimo, perchè diverso non è male ma arricchimento. Quindi quando la nostra Angie Patel fa amicizia ♥♥♥ il suo ospite parassita, mi chiedo perchè ho sverminato i gatti. A suo favore possiamo dire che meglio l'infezione del marito finno/congolese. Il gioco deve essere ambientato davvero in bel mondo, non vedo l'ora di visitare New Samarcanda!<br><br>Pro: i puzzle sono fantasiosi e ti obbligano a cercare soluzioni poco consone e sensate. La progressione della difficoltà ben calibrata.<br>Tecnicamente ineccepibile e ben ottimizzato.<br><br>Contro: troppo lungo, diventa sfiancante.<br>Trama senza ne capo ne coda.<br>Non c' è una vera colonna sonora e si sente la mancanza.<br>I muri invisibili nei livelli sono una cosa che dovrebbe essere vietata dai trattati internazionali.<br>Doppiaggio osceno. <br><br>Epico finale alla Mass Effect 3 ♥♥♥ morto che muove la mano. Epico davvero. <br>Se mi faccio un altro gatto lo chiamo Solidaridad, che ♥♥♥ Miranda e Talos ci sta bene come Ragnar ♥♥♥ Nguien.			</div>

																F*#ck you, Patel... this was a damn good game!<br><br>Ich habe es sehr gemocht und unglaublichen Spaß an den Physikrätseln gehabt.<br><br>- Ja, die Story ist etwas mäh... aber das ganze Ding schreit förmlich nach einem besseren zweiten Teil (siehe Portal)<br><br>- Die fast unsichtbaren Biom-Begrenzungen haben mich überhaupt nicht gestört. Was soll ich in einem Rätsel-Spiel rumlaufen wie in einem Open-World-Game? Wird ja schließlich auch in den Emails erklärt, dass es sich um abgetrennte Biome handelt.<br><br>- Die Grafik ist wirklich atemberaubend. Insgesamt habe ich die Atmosphäre in diesem Spiel sehr genossen. Die Sounds passen wunderbar. Die visuellen und auditiven Anleihen an Portal und System Shock 2 habe ich geliebt <br><br>- Einige Rätsel habe ich definitiv per Zufall beim Rumprobieren ohne Plan gelöst, einige Rätsel fand ich bis zur Unfairness unübersichtlich. Im Großen und Ganzen waren aber alle Rätsel lösbar. Und ich habe es geliebt, wenn das Game mich dazu gebracht hat, Out-of-the-Box zu denken<br><br>Wer Portal und ähnliche Spiele liebt, wird auch dieses Spiel mögen. <br>Ich hoffe, es gibt irgendwann einen zweiten Teil... ich werde diese gravitierenden Magnetwürfel, diese kleinen fiesen, und dann doch so nützlichen Drohnen... und die Saugroboter ;-) echt vermissen<br><br>			</div>

																I will not be comparing this game to Portal. It has not only been years since I've played that game, but many other reviews have already gone into depth with their comparisons between Relicta and Portal. I also believe it's better to judge a game focusing more on its individual qualities.<br>I have also <b>not completed</b> this game for reasons I will specify in this review.<br><br>tldr: Buy it only for the gameplay. The first 10 hours are excellent. If you get any more mileage out this game, I commend you.<br><br><div class="bb_h2"><b>Story</b></div>You control a scientist who loves spouting witty dialogue, whether it be to her daughter, her ex-husband, her colleagues, or the AI controlling the station. The voice acting is pretty good and it was interesting to hear english-speaking Indian voice actors. The plot itself is alright, but there's a pretty weak justification for the player to be doing all of these puzzles. You wouldn't want to play this game for the story. <br><br><div class="bb_h2"><b>Gameplay</b></div>Solving puzzles with gravitation and magnetic powers sounded daunting at first, but the first few hours did a really good job teaching the player how to use both of these mechanics. <br><br>Over the course of the game, you are also introduced to new obstacles that you must learn to circumvent. These range from color-coded barriers that prevent the player and/or blocks from passing through, switches that are powered from manual activation or pressure plates, and platforms with their own magnetism or movement properties. <br><br>One irritating note is that the game tries really hard to make sure that the puzzles are done in the most linear way possible. On every level, there are invisible ceilings and invisible walls. If you jump while sprinting, your jump will only go a fraction as high. You can only pick up blocks while you are on the ground. Ironically, I found completing the puzzles in unintended ways to be a much more fun approach, especially in mid-late game levels where numerous obstacles are stacked on top of each other and can take quite a long time to complete in the intended way. It was at this point in the game that I stopped having fun and I felt like I was doing work to complete each level. I no longer felt joy from thinking about what was coming next and instead every level was just one step closer to finishing the game. As such, I have yet to finish the game and I do not feel any motivation to continue. <br><br><div class="bb_h2"><b>Visuals</b></div>Relicta takes place over many different locations but absolutely none of them have any discernible effect on the puzzles. You also cannot interact with the environments in any way. The game runs at high graphics settings on my GTX 1650 at a solid 60 fps, but my GPU reaches temperatures around 75-78 Fahrenheit. This is surprising, considering that I am able to run games I would expect to be more graphically intensive at similar frame rate but much lower temperatures. I believe this game is not particularly well-optimized, but it's not a huge issue if you settle for medium/low graphics.<br><br><div class="bb_h2"><b>So why am I still recommending this game?</b></div>Because I can tell that the developers put a lot of work into the quality of this game. It has several shortcomings, but I am not in the slightest disappointed with the first 10 hours of my experience with the game. I believe if you get this on sale or in a bundle, it's worth playing to see if you might enjoy playing this game after the 10 hour mark.			</div>

																<blockquote class="bb_blockquote"><a class="bb_link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/curator/6142328/" target="_blank" rel=""><b>Like this Review? Follow The Cpt Froggy Club Curator Page for plenty more!</b></a></blockquote> <br>Upon loading the game you’ll be given the choice of playing the game in either DirectX 11 or DirectX 12. I never tried playing in DirectX 11 only in DirectX 12 and the game played fine. The game starts with Systems (AI) declaring a “Security Breach. This is not a drill. Initiating containment sequences...” The containment field in the Relicta chamber is collapsing, Doctor Laia Alami screams at Doctor Angelica Patel (you) not to approach the Relicta chamber! Ignoring her. Doctor Patel goes for a manual shutdown of the systems while Doctor Alami tries to override you and lock down the sector with Systems.  <br><br>While this is happening, there’s a critical containment failure, in the Relicta chamber. Systems identifies an Unidentified Malicious Vector, Emergency Lockdown is initiated, Core Systems have been compromised. Shutdown is in progress, as Doctor Alami politely screams for the override to prevent Doctor Patel from shutting down the system. It then goes dark and the story continues from an earlier point in time, 2118, two years earlier in the De Gerlache dome. The Der Gerlache dome is one of several terraformed biomes at the Chandra Base on the moon.  <br><br>You enter the dome it looks just like it would on Earth, multicoloured leaves adorn the trees, green grass and blue skies. You are testing the Gravitonic Wearable Interface (gloves) which you will use to move and manipulate cubes so that they can be placed on pressure pads. Upon placing the cubes on the pressure pads they will open forcefield gates. Sometimes you’ll have to place cubes on multiple pressure pads before a gate is opened. You can walk through some gates but not with carrying a cube. <br><br>Each cube has Positive and Negative Magnetism which are controlled by your left and right mouse button. So, that when you have two cubes that are the same colour they will have negative magnetism and will push away from each other, while two different colours will attract to each other. Turning the gravity on and off with the middle mouse button will then allow the cubes to float. Using the positive and negative magnetism will allow you to send your cubes further distances, pull them closer to where they are required or send them higher above the ground.  <br><br>You will also come across plates on the floor and walls and you’ll be able to change the magnetism to the same or opposite of the cubes. This will then allow you to send your cubes along a pathway to where they need to be. There are also some stations where you can place certain cubes and teleport it to another station. There are different types of stations each have a symbol to distinguish which cubes go where. You can then teleport the cubes to other areas that have a station behind a forcefield.  <br><br>There are multiple puzzle areas for each biome region you visit and after completing an area you’ll head back to Chandra Base. Upon returning to base the story will reveal its self some more and giving you some information on what is happening and what your next move will be. Also scattered around are collectable items to find and documents which will give you some information on what is going on at the Chandra Base. <br><br>In the Options there’s settings for Graphics (Resolution, Window Mode, Show FPS, FPS Limit, Render Scale, General Quality, Vegetation, Post Processing, Shadow Quality, Texture Quality, View Distance, Visual Effects, Antialiasing and V-Sync). Audio (Master, Music, Sound Effects and Voice Volume Sliders). Controls/Accessibility (Mouse Sensitivity X + Y, Controller Sensitivity X + Y, Invert Y Axis, View Bobbing, Motion Blur Crosshair Type). Languages (English, Spanish, French, Italian, German, Russian, Polish, Brazilian Portuguese and Chinese), Gamma, Key Binding and Tobi Eye Tracking. <br><br>Relicta is a great looking first-person physics-based puzzle game that takes place in terraformed biomes on the moon. The puzzles can be challenging but with a bit of thought you’ll figure them out. There is some “French” language in the game which doesn’t bother me at all but it may offend some folks. I’ve had one problem while playing and I got stuck between a cube station and a wall after jumping around. However, a quick reboot and it was back to normal and haven’t had any other problems so far. <br><br>Positives <br>+ Looks great <br>+ Challenging puzzles <br>+ Decent story <br>+ Has achievements <br><br>Negatives <br>- Can be frustrating at times <br>- No cards currently <br><br>Combine magnetism and gravity to complete puzzles in biomes on the moon in this first-person physics-based game.  <br><br>7/10  <br><br><blockquote class="bb_blockquote">Key provided by developer/publisher for review purposes via THE CPT FROGGY CLUB!  <br><br>Any opinions expressed are entirely my own! </blockquote> <br><blockquote class="bb_blockquote">For more reviews, great game giveaways and much more. <br><br>Come join us @ <a class="bb_link" href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.Zeepond.Com" target="_blank" rel=" noopener">www.Zeepond.Com</a> and <a class="bb_link" href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/thecptfroggyclub" target="_blank" rel="">The Cpt Froggy Club</a> Steam Group</blockquote>			</div>

																IF you like solving puzzles...Get this game!<br>You can immediately tell that The Developers have spend a lot of time and work to get this game to this level of perfection.<br>The environment and graphics look great, play is smooth without any glitches or bugs, and the puzzles are wonderful (Some are very hard and some are very easy and the rest fall somewhere in-between)...BUT they are all fair and logical. <br>  My Main Gripe with the game is the SAVE Game Feature.&lt;&lt;&lt;The Game Saves Itself When It Wants To. You have No Control on when to save your progress.<br>  Example: You may have worked on a puzzle for over an hour, made great progress on getting through it but you have to quit the game for whatever reason. The next time that you start, you will be BACK at the beginning of the puzzle and not where you left off when you quit and that is VERY Frustrating.{But don't let that stop you from experiencing this game.  <br>  My only little nit-pic is: Between the puzzles, you have to go through this needless array of rooms, trams, etc. that, to me, was just a confusing waste of time and it felt disjointed from the puzzles. (Would have worked Much Better if that part of the game flowed more easily. It felt like you were playing two games at once...one puzzle and one adventure)<br>And that would be great IF the connection between the two would have been smoother.<br>  Overall - I think that it is a Fantastic value for the price and I'd say buy it immediately. <br>BUT...The Wonderful thing that The Developers have done is given you a DEMO to check out...Do This NOW!<br>That way you can form your own opinion before purchasing.<br>I've read people saying things like This is No Portal or Talos Principle and PERHAPS it isn't BUT I'd say that this game is 'right-up-there'.<br>UPTATE: I'm 40 hours into this game (40 HOURS!) and it's still going....LOVE IT !!!			</div>

																<i> Relicta is a puzzle game that tries to be like The Talos Principle and Portal, but falls flat. The gameplay mechanics, as well as the physics, are a solid and fun experience. However, it falls short due to a weak story, terribly written dialogue, repetitive puzzle design, and various technical issues. If you’re looking for a puzzler that you can easily find exploits in for a speedrun, check this out. But, if you’re looking for a puzzler with replayability, where you have to utilize creative thinking, and the puzzles are all uniquely designed, then look far, far elsewhere.</i><br>- Summary from my <a class="bb_link" href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fgamingtrend.com%2Ffeature%2Freviews%2Fif-rube-goldberg-made-a-puzzle-game-itd-be-a-repetitive-mess-like-this-one-relicta-review%2F" target="_blank" rel=" noopener"> review </a><span class="bb_link_host">[gamingtrend.com]</span> on Gaming Trend<br><br><b> PROS </b><br>- Plenty of fun to be found in determining exploits<br>- Gameplay mechanics and physics are fun<br><br><br><b> ♥♥♥♥ </b><br>- Repetitive puzzles that do not require creative thinking to complete<br>- Terribly written dialogue, coupled with a story that drops off in quality by the end<br>- Artificial difficulty that is only there to waste your time<br>- Various technical issues			</div>

																Nice puzzler akin to talos principle or gravitas. Other than some other reviewers, I enjoyed the story. And I really adore the design of the Labs.<br>It makes a bit too much usage of invisible walls, and the domes from the inside don't look like domes, which was a bit sad. Also, I got softlocked twice, which sucked, as there are no in-puzzle-save-points and some puzzles can get big.<br><br>Didn't quite understand the background lore tho. Why would aegis labs or what they were called build domes in the first place, if all they wanted was ice and the relict?			</div>

																It's fine. The main puzzle elements are shooting blocks from one magnetic plate to another and navigating colored gates that are only permissible to certain things (purple you can cross, green blocks can cross, gold nothing can). The first two areas are really nice, I loved some of the momentum puzzles in the second location. In fact, I thought the game was going to end in the ice caves, the last few puzzles were by far the best in the whole game.<br><br>Sadly, it's just fine, not great. The game runs out of ideas fast. Later levels are just full of tedious steps. Blocks are hidden on the ceiling, elevators are hidden around corners, switches are wired in confusing ways (this is obviously intentional, and funny at first, but after a while you just want the wires to be clearly placed), etc. Later puzzles are full of extra little steps, just padding to slow you down. If the game was 3 hours long I would have loved every minute.<br><br>There is a story, in the technical sense that they included one. It's boring, is not integrated with the game at all, and the dialogue is... strange. Lots of swearing, like a 14 year old boy with something to prove, but coming out of the mouths of 40 year old women. There is some political intrigue stuff which is interesting, but since it's all just spoken into your ear via radio it's more like you are playing a puzzle game while a strange radio drama full of way, way too many F-bombs.<br><br>It's a fine puzzle game, and there aren't many of those, so I'm recommending it on that basis alone. But this isn't spectacular.			</div>

																<b>Pros:</b><br>+ Nice visuals<br>+ Pretty good atmosphere/setting/lore<br><br><b>♥♥♥♥:</b><br>- Puzzles don't get more complex, just longer<br>- Puzzles are extremely repetitive and tedious<br>- The game is insanely long and dragged out (16 hrs first completion)<br>- Annoying protagonist with annoying voice acting<br>- Many puzzles can be broken or partially skipped<br>- Invisible walls absolutely everywhere around you<br><br>Gosh, this was such an insane drag. I really, really wanted to quit Relicta since about halfway through and the only reason I didn't is because I'm just so dead-set on 100%'ing every half-playable game I come across. Honestly, this was borderline masochistic.<br><br>The game throws a couple unique puzzle mechanics at you in the beginning and then proceeds to reuse them literal hundreds of times over. The puzzles grow larger and larger later on; they <i>seem</i> complicated at first, but they really aren't. At any given moment you can only do one particular thing to advance the puzzle. Basically you're solving a dozen tiny, isolated, already-done-before, and mostly trivial sub-puzzles to proceed.<br><br>The puzzles sucked so much man, it's all just busywork. I constantly wished I could just noclip to the next area and be done with it. The only times you get to actually think creatively is when you break the puzzles and skip entire sections of them. This normally would be pretty cool actually, except the method to break a particular puzzle comes to mind first, and how to solve it the intended way comes to mind much later. Or never at all. That is not good. That's just poor testing.<br><br>The game tries so hard to be "like Talos Principle" except the writing is nowhere near as good and there's bloody zero exploration involved. In Talos, you could climb almost everything you see, or bring an item from one puzzle to another via clever tricks. But in Relicta absolutely everything is smeared with invisible walls everywhere, so no exploring for you whatsoever, sir.<br><br>Finally, can I have less of this "strong independent Indian woman VS oppressive manipulative men" crap in my videogames please? It's not exactly in-your-face but it was hard to pretend like it's not there. The very thick Indian accent of the protagonist (and several other characters) made it difficult for me to get invested in the story. Call me politically incorrect all you want but English isn't even my native language and the accents still made me chuckle instead of being empathic whenever drama happens. I just couldn't take it too seriously.			</div>

																Either the concept isn't great, or it starts off way too slow. Right off the hop games like Portal are immediately funny and hook you.  I was playing this for 30 mins and waiting for it to get fun or interesting.			</div>

																The game looks nice, puzzle elements are fun and challenging, and overworld is well designed.<br><br>The story is atrocious, as if written by a neglected toddler. Just bizarre how poorly it was done. Bizarre how a publisher let this go out. The story was all just passive, remote dialogue - no animations or interactions, just pure voice acting. It would have taken such little funding to change it. They could have even made it a silent game without any dialogue and it would actually improve the game. <br><br>Such a stark contrast with the attractive design of the world/puzzles.<br><br>.....At least until you get about 10 hours in to the game, then the puzzles start to reflect more closely to the story. Almost as if there were quotas for every puzzle to have more and more steps  - but no additional challenge. They devolve from fun exploration of gravity/magnetism/ordering, to pure busy work, running extended strings of movement without error. Almost like it changed from a puzzle game to a programming game. There is zero room for creativity in any solution, you have to do it exactly as they intended. They even went back and added a bunch of walls to prevent creative solutions. The programming aspects are tedious - having to go back through a 2 minute sequence because a box clipped a tiny edge is not fun. The puzzles also become much larger towards the end, to the point you have to complete 3-5 full puzzles worth of content before you can get a save point.<br><br>They even added a huge number of free DLC maps, almost doubling the game. And those reflect perfectly to the base game. Terrible dialogue that makes me want to play silently, and puzzles that are more of a chore than challenge.<br><br>All in all, I'd say there are 5 up-front hours of fun game. Then 10-15 hours of unpleasant, tedious work.<br><br>Maybe get it on a deep sale and play til it stops being fun.			</div>

																I completed this game on a different platform.<br><br>There are 3 different intros each time you open the game and one of them is a loud raven. Unskippable too. Totally not needed.<br><br>Awful dialogue and storytelling, almost makes me not wanna recommend the game. I wish I didn't have to listen to it whatsoever.<br><br>Transitioning between levels through the base can leave you often lost in a huge maze as the game only tells you where to go once and provides no additional indicators, so you can end up wasting even up to 5 minutes just to get to the next puzzle tracks set. I just wanna play the game, I don't care about the base especially when there's nothing meaningful on it. The long embarking and lift animations don't add anything good to it either.<br><br>Also, you can get stuck. Literally. The game has some ways to prevent it but it's inevitable to eventually occur and then you have to restart. It comes from the player's error but it should not be possible, especially when the game is already so restrictive on what you can do with all the plaster-like blockages such as the invisible barriers and inability to interact with cubes while jumping.<br><br>However, the game-play is wonderful if you're just a puzzle enthusiast and this is what makes me recommend this game. The levels get progressively more difficult, challenging and complex, introducing some additional mechanics that sometimes have to be used in unique ways. It's always logical what you have to do when you take it step by step. Doing random things until it works is not an option so it requires you to analyze the levels and think of your options.<br><br>The graphics are incredibly wonderful with stunning views, landscapes and a beautiful detailed environment. I was left jaw dropped when I witnessed just how gorgeous this game can look. A screenshot from afar can look like a picture taken in real-life on an expedition. It's very eye-pleasing. But you don't get to see the best of it until a bit later in the game. Each set of puzzles has its own thematic: forest, jungle, canyon, glaciar, etc. so the game doesn't feel repetitive visuals wise.<br><br>The sounds effects are satisfying and the environmental noises are really good, especially in the tropical beach levels. Don't know what to say about the soundtrack as I don't have a good musical ear but I wasn't bothered nor dissatisfied by it.<br><br>It has a lot of negatives but I just wanted to complete puzzles and this is what I got. If you think the same as me, this is a good game for you.			</div>

																Relicta is an interesting first person puzzle game. I personally really liked it. In different domes (themed areas), you have to solve puzzles by using the power of magnets. Same color repels, different color attracts. This simple mechanic never changes and you will have to manipulate cubes and plates to activate switches and open up paths.<br><br>The game slowly introduces some additional obstacles over the course of its rather lengthy campaign, though the base mechanics won't change. Including the two content packs that come with the game, it took me 25 hours to beat it which is more than generous for the price. The game looks good, the different areas are varied and the mechanic and the physics attached to it work very well.<br><br>There are a few negatives though. Let's address the elephant in the room first: the dialogue is absolutely horrendous. At first, I thought that the characters acting more human by showing weaknesses and swearing a lot would add some spice to the game, but it gets tiring very, very quickly. I am assuming that the dialogue is meant to be funny and lighthearted, but it is completely misplaced and only rarely humorous. The voice actors are top notch though and they did a great job delivering even the most cringeworthy lines. <br><br>The story is nothing to write home about - it's okay, really - but hearing a demonic alien voice unironically say "new phone, who this?" made me walk away from my computer and contemplate life for a few minutes. If only I would smoke, I could have completed that dramatic moment as I made my way towards the balcony and gazed into the distance. My wife was like "did I just hear this right"? If I would get a penny for every time a character would say "f***" or "s***" for no reason in this game, I would have enough to fill a pretty big swear jar. Seriously, though, the dialogue is a goldmine for cringe - a word I only use when it is absolutely warranted, so trust me on this. It is honestly oddly endearing, but also really annoying. A weird mix.<br><br>The puzzles themselves also have some weaknesses - the biggest one is that they never change and are overall rather easy. New obstacles mix it up here and there, but every single puzzle in this game can be solved by finding the one thing you can do and going from there. They get really big and complex eventually, but even that doesn't matter. It's always: find the start point, go from there. This completely eliminates trial &amp; error - which is a <b>really good thing</b> - but the base mechanics are sadly not varied enough to ever really make the puzzles challenging or elevate them above "mildly difficult at times", and often that is just due to the inherent complexity of some of the levels. I love puzzle games without trial &amp; error, but I almost think Relicta went to far in the opposite direction at times.<br><br>Still, though, I definitely recommend Relicta. You can tell that the developers and everyone who contributed put a lot of effort into this. An orchestrated soundtrack, a ton of puzzles - maybe a few too many - and great voice actors make the game worth playing, even if it stretches a bit thin in the last few hours. Just try to take breaks to calm down your annoyance levels at some of the dialogue.			</div>

																Thumbs up/down is really insufficient sometimes and here is such a ~meh~ case.<br><br>I am one of the few people that actually kinda liked Magrunner Dark Pulse and this game is basically the exact same mechanics. Yet here the puzzles feel somehow even more fiddly. <br><br>Whenever I finish a puzzle I look up what was the intended solution as the way I did it felt like exploiting some kind of bug or unintended solution. And it is not a good sign when most of the time I was correct in that assessment. <br><br>Examples: In a cave I skipped half the puzzle because I rode the cube through a small gap in a green field rather than using the spot on the other side of the cave which then afterwards made feel stuck since I couldn't figure out what this part of the level was for. Or I would just jump and drop a cube on a ledge you were supposed to ride a cube to. <br><br>Let's talk aesthetics. I feel like the idea to set this game on the moon was an after thought as most enviroments are just forests or caves with not a hint of the moon in sight. Problem is: with all that useless nature surrounding you it makes the puzzles harder to parse. Obvious comparison is Talos Principle but that game had a) cross puzzle secrets and b) was much more visually clear than this game. Worse are the "hands off" puzzles where you have to guide a cube through a maze by changing magnetism. Except you can't see the entire track most of the time and have to do it without seeing where the cube got stuck this time. That the walls are made out wood instead of just something transparent adds to the problem. <br><br>There is a sort of Hub in game that let's you go back to old areas but you can't actually enter the puzzles and only go to the entrance if you missed a collectible, thus rendering it useless. It's weird having a completely linear game have a useless hub.<br><br>Speaking of the story: You start with an intro cutscene where you don't know what is happening. Then you play everything up to that point but nothing that was important was explained in the mean time. Afterwards you are also on your own again with the other characters basically not mattering anymore, which would be more an issue if all the characters didn't have the same personality anyway. They are all Woman who swears alot which is basically a worse version of Lishari Peghast.<br><br>As said the game is not great. But the visuals are nice and some of the puzzles are kinda fun. So if you some one that can put up with a lot of jank then you can try the game for yourself.			</div>

																Bardzo dobra gra logiczna. Jak ktoś grał w Portala czy Talos Principle to tutaj też się odnajdzie. Zagadki są momentami naprawdę trudne. Z drugiej strony jak dobrze pokombinujesz to uda ci się rozwiązać zagadkę inaczej, niż przewidzieli to twórcy (np. wciągając w jeden obszar więcej sześcianów niż powinieneś w tym momencie mieć). Jeśli miałbym wymienić jakieś minusy to jest tu trochę za dużo nieuzasadnionego przeklinania, zwłaszcza w DLC Ice Queen.			</div>

																Замечательная игра. Прошел на одном дыхании (потратил 2 дня). Рекомендую.<br>Сюжета как такового я не особо заметил (быть может меня больше интересовали сами головоломки). Игра отчасти похожа на Q.U.B.E, Portal, .T.E.S.T, The Talos Principle. В каких-то головоломках возникало ощущение их сложностей, однако это иллюзия. Ничего чрезмерно сложного здесь нет. Наоборот, занимательно. Не оторваться.<br>Хотелось бы продолжения, только вряд-ли, несмотря на намеки в одной из концовок. А сами концовки скомканные.<br>Еще в игре не хватает жизни. Вы (аватара ГГ) повсюду один (даже в кат.сценах). Нет возможности добавить людей, так пусть будут хотя-бы животные. Кстати, личности персонажей до конца не раскрыты, а некоторых и вовсе как-бы выбросили с диалогов "забыв" про них.<br>Все же играть стоит. 8/10			</div>

																REVISED - Thumbs up after 100 hours of play after rating Thumbs down only a dozen hours in.  Stick with it - it gets better.  Especially the bonus level Ice Queen - very Portal 2-esque.<br><br>Great concept.  Combine a Portal or Talos Principle type cube &amp; button puzzle adventure game with magnetism and anti-gravity and weave a story into the reason for having to pass various testing chambers.  The early chambers are fairly easy, then applying logic becomes more important, but unfortunately near the end the puzzles start depending on very quick timing, which is very challenging for mobility impaired players and have nothing whatsoever to do with puzzle solving capability.  Unfortunate.  That said, if you stick with it, you will be rewarded with more challenging puzzles.<br>I  recommend it because I love the genre and applaud efforts by developers to build such games, but be cautioned that the UI is a bit glitchy and the fact that in some of the long puzzles near the end there is no intermediate save functionality (meaning you have to completely restart a long level if you have to quit before completing the whole level - which compounds the whole dexterity/speed issue).			</div>

																A puzzle game that gets ruined by hidden mechanics and terrible writing...<br><br>The game itself isn't too bad if you just think about the puzzles itself. The only main thing is that you have to walk around to find every corner of each difficult puzzle to see if you've missed a cube or teleporter.<br><br>The worst part is the writing. The characters act weird ALL the time. The boss is always screaming at everyone, but then 2 minutes later can have a "normal" conversation with the same person she screamed at..<br>The main character for some reason sings a line about "going to the moon" which the the AI called Sys(short for System...) interrupts her to say "but we're already on the moon". Such a usefull conversation, not at all forcefully written to say "AI are robots who doesn't understand human behavior"...<br><br>2/10 - Couldn't even finish the game because of the terrible writing and annoying puzzle mechanics that are for luck only.			</div>

																Relicta is another superb entry in the first person puzzle genre.  It follows a format reminiscent of Portal 2, mixing puzzle areas and narrative storytelling, though with a hub area layout more similar to The Talos Principle.  I personally enjoyed the sci-fi story and and appreciated the really solid voicework that goes along with it.<br><br>Gameplay mostly revolves around manipulating blocks and pressing switches using magnetic charges and being able to toggle gravity on said blocks.  Various types of forcefields also need to be worked around, and a few other mechanics are added later.  I found the vast majority of the puzzles to be intuitive, even the later puzzles which get rather long.  There were a few instances in the final chapters of the game however where I found some puzzle steps overly fiddly since they rely too much on free form physics simulation.<br><br>Relicta is a very good-looking game with beautifully-designed environments and utilizing the high quality presentation of Unreal Engine.  It runs very well too, staying locked at 120 fps the vast majority of the time on my GTX 1070 and scales down really well to even older mid-range hardware.  The only fault I can find is the "dirt" overlay on the camera that can really get in the way of appreciating the game's visuals in certain lighting conditions.  I'm sure it's supposed to simulate the character's helmet, but I can't imagine anyone would wear such a dirty visor without cleaning it.<br><br>So overall, I highly recommend this game.  I can't get enough of good first person puzzle games and it's nice to play a higher quality production again since they don't come around very often.<br><br>Edit: Two free DLCs were released for the game (accessed from Extras on the main menu,) containing about 12 lengthy and difficult puzzles each along with new story dialogue.  I was very impressed with the quantity and quality of this content, particularly since it's free.  But while the puzzles are good, there are some issues.  It's very easy to block progress in many of the puzzles and force you to reset - which can be a large setback due to how long many of them are.  I also ran into some issues with overly complicated physics movements not being reliable.  Overall though, a very satisfying addition to the game.			</div>

																Nie jestem fanem gier logicznych, zobaczyłem poradnik, że trwa 3 godziny i 26 minut, a że tanie i krótkie gry to dla mnie plus to kupiłem.<br>Tyle że realnie wszystko zajęło jakieś 8 razy dłużej niż ten poradnik. Aż tak wciągnęło.<br>Relicta bazuje na klockach które można naładować na czerwono lub niebiesko, oraz dodać/odjąć grawitację. To samo można zrobić z wieloma elementami gry, także i ruchomymi, by odpychać klocki lub je przyciągać, a po wyłączeniu grawitacji stojąc na nich na nich fruwać. Klocki, pieczołowicie ustawiane w odpowiednich miejscach odblokowują nam drogę dalej, lub też np. zmieniają barierę z "tylko dla klocków" na "tylko dla gracza". Jedno muszę przyznać co w tej grze jest genialne - ma świetne łamigłówki oraz doskonale się rozkręca. Przez zdecydowaną większość gry jak dla mnie lepsza niż Portal 1 czy 2 jeśli chodzi o same zagadki. Twórcy wykorzystują wraz z upływem czasu coraz to mniej oczywiste rozwiązania (jak ruchoma platforma z możliwością naładowania jej od spodu co łatwo przegapić, serię grawitacyjnych punktów tworzących tor da klocka by dotarł do celu), a także dochodzą nowe elementy gry. To co ważne - nie ma tu ani większego szoku, ani przesadnej powtarzalności. Gra jest jednak trudna i to tak na serio.<br>Choć większość zagadek ma jedno rozwiązanie to jednak wcale tak nie mało można trafić na więcej, a nawet (choć już bardzo rzadko) pójść na skróty. Po przejściu zawsze sprawdzałem "co na to solucja" i nie raz byłem zadowolony że wynalazłem coś ciekawszego.<br>Mały plus za całkiem fajną opowiastkę oraz grafikę. Niby nie było to jakoś potrzebne, ale zawsze pozytywnie wpływa to na odbiór. minus za bazę do której wracamy - brzydka, powtarzalna, a te znajdźki w niej u mnie nie zaplusowały, bo takie na siłę. Czasem też wszystko trwało zbyt długo, chyba szkoda że twórcy nie zaimplementowali cofania czasu. W trudnych grach łażenie w tę i we w tę obniża satysfakcję z gry, wołałbym spędzać jak najmniej czasu na łażeniu a jak najwięcej na myśleniu.<br>Przez większość gry wahałem się z oceną gry i tak 8,5 wydało mi się w sam raz, pomimo wszelakich pomimo. Niestety obniżam o 1 punkt za ostatni etap (każdy składa się z kilku map). W nim gra przerosła twórców i kilka razy musiałem restartować mapkę bo nie było już żadnego powrotu, coś co nie zdarzyło mi się ani razu wcześniej, tylko podczas ostatniego etapu. W efekcie był on po prostu frustrujący i zamiast dobrego humoru pozostał mały niesmak.<br>Ocena 7,5/10. Byłoby o punkt więcej, gdyby nie ostatni etap, to naprawdę świetna gra.			</div>

																Если вы любитель головоломок, игнорирующий все другие составляющие игры, то, возможно, Relicta для вас может быть неплохим приобретением: средней сложности с тяготением к сложным испытания вам могут прийтись по вкусу, несмотря на ощущающуюся однотипность.<br>Всё остальное не восхищает. Картинка ничем не в техническом плане не примечательна. Модели в большинстве своём простенькие. Физика настолько реалистичная, что некоторые препятствия можно преодолеть на плавно дрейфующем по воздуху кубике, не сумевшем остановиться в задуманном создателями месте. Уровни созданы с активным применением невидимых стен-полей. Диалоги — это просто финиш — то ли перепалки двух девок на районе, то ли аутентичное общение в каком-нибудь провинциальном отделе прикладной разработки транснационального ИТ гиганта, ну хоть на том спасибо, что членами друг друга не обкладывают. Фабула, во всяком случае первой части игры, написана для галочки, хотя пролог обещает некоторое драматическое развитие и, предполагаю, неожиданные повороты.			</div>

																Узнав, что разработкой игры занимается всего несколько человек я был приятно удивлен! Каждый раз меня радует, что годноту может делать горстка людей, а гов..ноту смело позволяет себе делать даже большая и жадная компания. <br>Соблазнил безусловно ценник (около 500р) и реклама игры как идейного продолжателя небезызвестного Portal. Поиграв несколько часов я понял, что в этой игре-головомке есть в принципе все что нужно. Тут есть: сложные задачи, приятная картинка, футуристическое будущее, добротная озвучка и даже сюжет. Конечно же упор Relicta сделан прежде всего на решение головоломок после решения которых чувствуется приятное  ощущение в роде :"хмм а я не такой безнадежный!".<br>Смело могу порекомендовать Relicta для прохождения тем людям, которые не ищут от игры легких путей, любят напрячь свой мозг и решать головоломки!<br>UPD спустя почти 20 часов. <br>Головоломки великолепны, если не обращать внимание на сюжет, который к сожалению без персонажей просто натянут, то игра хороша. Хочешь попытать мозг, воображение, внимательность и задницу на возгорание -  игра идеально для этого подходит. Что касается сюжета - затянут самими головоломками.<br><br><a class="bb_link" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHEwVYzdW_bresl9fwuvkwE_5F_aUHJy1" target="_blank" rel="">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHEwVYzdW_bresl9fwuvkwE_5F_aUHJy1</a>			</div>

																Реликта начинается в СМИ. Вы находитесь в гравитационных перчатках физика по имени Анжелика Патель, когда она пытается справиться с кризисом. Титульный экземпляр вызывает опасные аномалии на терраформированной лунной базе Чандра, где она и ее коллеги проводят все свои исследования. Она врывается в камеру, в которой он находится, с намерением все выключить. Но, прежде чем она успела это сделать, он раскрывается, обвивает щупальце ее запястье и тянет ее в трещину.<br><br>Затем игра переносится на годы назад к более раннему тренировочному упражнению, в котором Энджи участвовала в лесном биоме Чандры. Оттуда прорисовываются детали, и вы лучше понимаете, кто все такие и что с ними происходит. Как и в большинстве головоломок от первого лица, вы будете тратить время на решение головоломок в одиночестве. Но Энджи часто общается с другими людьми, которые в основном состоят из ее дочери студенческого возраста Киры и ее коллеги по работе Лайи. Да и ИИ системы, которого она называет «Сис»<br><br>Как и в  Portal , головоломки в  Relicta происходят в камерах тестирования. Только здесь они все в разных биомах. Лес, тундра, скалистый каньон, прекрасный пляж – каждая среда по-своему впечатляет. Вам нужно выяснить, как установить ящик на различные переключатели, чтобы открыть путь вперед. <br><br>Энджи носит пару перчаток для управления гравитацией, одна из которых синяя, а другая красная. Они работают так же, как и два цвета порталов, ну, вы знаете, но особенности совершенно разные. Все поля, с которыми вы сталкиваетесь, по умолчанию серые, и вы можете изменить их цвет в любое время, а также включить их функцию антигравитации, которая позволяет им легко перемещаться под действием любой силы гравитации, действующей на них.<br><br> Чтобы успешно решить множество головоломок Relicta , вам нужно использовать эти панели и другие подобные устройства, чтобы перемещать ящики, куда они должны пойти.<br><br>Проще говоря, Relicta – это отдельный класс. Его дизайн часто на голову превосходит многих своих современников, текст высочайшего качества, а игра выглядит намного лучше, чем это действительно нужно. Абсолютно каждый, кто считает себя фанатом этого жанра, обязан играть в эту игру. Это перенесет вас на Луну. И другой мир где вы еще не были .			</div>

																说实话这个游戏风格还好，就是拿箱子那里有bug。希望开发商更新一下，按E拿箱子拿不了，无论是长按E键还是点击一下E键都是拿不了箱子。只有箱子位置在按压板那里的时候才能拿的了箱子，但还是不能移动的那种无语，希望赶紧更新一下这个bug吧			</div>

																Relicta is a Portal Clone. I love Portal Clones. But not like this...<br>Firstly I don't know why but whenever an indie or even AA studio gets their hands on the Unreal engine they manage to make it hog way more performance than it's worth. This is another example of that, just bad frames over heating my computer for no reason. <br>The assets and voice lines are super high quality. The story is a drag for the first 3 hours but the intrigue hits after shoemaker which makes you want to continue. The gameplay.... it's nothing we haven't seen before. <br><br>I've played every Portal Clone under the sun and this is just the least fun I've had solving puzzles in a test chamber. The game just removes all the usual toys from you. The Y rotation of every cube is permanently locked, there's invisible walls everywhere, you can't let go of boxes in midair, the physics is just tame, quickly picking up up boxes while running is just not a thing, and this game features one of the most unsatisfying jump arcs ever. It's more of a *Huughh!* than a jump.<br>There's also so many fudgable solutions that sometimes make me wonder if I just cheesed something... which I prbly did at least twice...<br><br>I do plan on completing the game but I can only take a little of it at a time.			</div>

																I have to give it a hard "Meh." It has interesting puzzle gameplay, but the plot is boring and dull. The environments look pretty, but they're too complex for the gameplay; and make it hard to know what you're supposed to be doing. I spent about 10 minutes trying to solve a puzzle incorrectly because the admittedly very pretty level design made me think there was a completely different answer.<br><br>Also, the soundtrack is uninspired. This is a game where you're supposed to stand around, think, and solve logic puzzles. You don't want an overpowering or distracting soundtrack, but you want something to help you not stress about the puzzles so much.<br><br>If you enjoy puzzle games like the Witness, or Myst, with very little active plot and just puzzles presented to the player, I recommend the game.			</div>

																It is a great title, but I progressively became bored and frustrated. Showing interest in other titles in my collection and those on sale.<br><br>Deadcore, Impulsion, Desync, Neon Boost, SEUM Speed Runners from Hell were thoroughly enjoyable. But certainly Kovaak's Aim Trainer (every week), is my main (puzzle) skill test game that I have enjoyed and prefer.<br><br>I did use youtube QUITE a few times for Relicta, as with my interest becoming lost. I just couldn't figure things out and enjoy it all the way through as much as I was doing from the start. Memorising what you can and can't do, It isn't as simple as say Portal 1 &amp; 2. Also I'm finding this genre tends to get more annoying than entertaining lol.<br><br>The story dialog helped feed me, the audio, graphics and game play are all very good, but I still wanted to player other games, like Quake Champions more so... we can't help what we like most can we.<br><br>Combat sections (50% complete at time of review) if yet to come? would help break up, having my brain tested and feeling stupid.<br><br>:)      8/10 - I will complete this, but in very spaced out sessions, likely over the course of 2021/22.			</div>

																The attempt towards making a portal-esque puzzle game is respectable, but the game is very flawed. For starters, some of the puzzles(even at the later stages) make no sense at all from a logical standpoint. The puzzles revolve around gravitational mechanisms but maintain no consistency in how the cubes move or function. Secondly, the story and the dialogues are pretty boring and lame in my opinion, and I can't seem to enjoy any of the characters or their dialogues. I have no interest in finishing the game with such mediocre and inconsistent puzzles and a boring story who's only positive attribute can be the space and sci-fi setting, which can at least be said to be respectable. But the part that really made me dislike this game are the jumping mechanics. It is EXTREMELY frustrating to jump in this game as the player jumps way too low and requires multiple attempts just to get over a ledge. Parts where you're elevated from the ground and have to jump over a tiny ledge can be frustrating when you keep falling off and pretty much have to repeat the puzzle over again. This one tiny flaw really put the nail in the coffin for this game, and makes it borderline unplayable. Decent graphics and atmosphere mean nothing when the mechanics are so poorly made. I love puzzle games such as The Talos Principle, The Witness and Portal and each have their own amazing traits that make them unique amongst each other which elevates them into the pantheon of great puzzle games. But this game is far far inferior to even the average ones such as The Turing Test. I would not recommend this game unless you've played every other puzzle game out there and are obsessed with the genre like I am. But even I couldn't really get into this game. 4/10 at best.			</div>

																Relicta is a flawed masterpiece. The puzzles are challenging and clever and had me hooked all the way through. The game should appeal to anyone who likes the "test chamber" genre (Portal, Talos Principle, Turing Test, Q.U.B.E.). A fairly simple cube mechanic is steadily built upon incrementally and there never seemed like there was an unfair learning curve. Huge congratulations to the puzzle designers as the game is also quite long and each puzzle area has a unique take on the mechanics.<br><br>The graphics and environments are also stunning, even running on 4-5 year old PC on low graphics.<br><br>The storyline is pretty silly as a loose way of linking test chambers but is at least a partial driving force to hold the whole thing together. One thing that baffled me is the dialogue has a huge amount of swearing. It doesn't bother me so much, but I feel the developers could easily have removed this (or had some way to censor it - there isn't) to make the game fun for all age groups.<br><br>Enjoyed from start to finish, and look forward to more from the developers.			</div>

																ブロックに磁力を与えることが出来るグローブを使い、極性を変化させながら引力と斥力を使ってスイッチを操作する一人称パズルゲーム。基本的に出来ることは赤と青の磁石の極性を変化させることのみで単純だが、それらの組み合わせと応用による操作パターンは多く、パズルとして考えることはそれなりに複雑。しかし、それでありながら物理的・直感的なイメージから外れず、「こうすればこうなるだろう」と考えて準備した通りの挙動を見事にトレースしてくれるのは気持ち良く、パズルゲームとしてのデキの良さが伺える。<br><br>難易度は序盤からやや高め。磁力によりブロックを反発させる際の挙動や力の掛かり方を学ぶいわゆるチュートリアルに近いステージだが、ゲーム内では現実よりもパズルとしての規則性を優先するためか、磁石の反発力を使う場合に若干コツというか特別な理解が必要になる。しかし丁寧に教えてくれるわけでもなく、試して覚えるしか無いのでここが辛いところ。ここでコツさえ掴んでしまえばその後はゲーム進捗による難易度の上昇率はゆるやかで、少し悩むところもあれば妙に簡単なステージもごちゃ混ぜで現れてくる。なので序盤の難易度に驚いてやめてしまうのは勿体ないので、なんとかコツを探り当てて切り抜けてほしい。それが出来ればその後は気持ちよくパズルを楽しめる。<br><br>欠点といえば、先に書いたような序盤の優しさのない難易度と妙にダラダラ喋り続けるわりに理解しづらいストーリーくらいか（会話はスキップできるが）。広いステージでも細かくプレイ可能なエリアが区切られているので、どこから手を付けて良いのか分からずパズル以外のところで悩むなんてことはなく、段階的に進捗を感じられるように作られているのはユーザーに優しい。パズルの質は高く、考え方に無理はなく、操作性も良い。またボリュームも十分で、一人称パズル好きの私があまり詰まること無く体感でスイスイ解き進めてもクリアまで12時間以上遊べるくらいにはある。おすすめ。			</div>

																這解謎遊戲還不錯，雖然前面幾關都大同小異，不過最後一關設計的還滿有趣的，這關有幾個跟地圖互動的解謎還滿酷的，而且謎題跟地圖結合的算是滿自然的，比較少會有自然環境跟謎題硬結合的感覺。<br>感覺作者可以活用地圖，尤其這場景做的還不錯，又分這麼多不同的環境。我認為可以將謎題與該地圖的主題更加的融合在一起，而不是只有單純的解謎，這樣容易讓模式較單一、沒有新奇感，導致無法玩太久且感受不到場景環境帶來的震撼。			</div>

																Impressive puzzle game. Very addictive and inmersive with a story plenty of mistery and surprises.<br><br>I bought the game unexpectly because I couldn't stay long hours playing but the autosaving system has let me stop playing and start again after few days.<br><br>Puzzles are usually hard but you won't get stucked and you will have a lot of fun. I highly recommend this game.			</div>

																Довольно приличная игра-головоломка в стиле Portal. Физика кубов здесь довольно простая, но зато с ее помощью можно найти огромное количество обходных путей. 60% уровней можно пройти не так, как задумано разработчиками, надо только немного терпения и внимательности. <br>Сюжет простенький, графика красивая. Больше в принципе сказать и нечего. Пойдет для тренировки мозга =)			</div>

																It's a decent puzzle game. It could be a bit shorter. The first half is a bit boring as you go through the simple puzzles but they get more complex. Good graphics and an okay story. And it's refreshing to not hear American or English accents for a change.<br><br>Edit: Fair play to the developers for releasing 2 free DLC which (so far) have better puzzles.			</div>

																Fired this up and played through the main story again, as well as the 2 expansion packs that were recently released.  The story, dialogue, and voice acting in the expansion packs remain just as hammy and cheesy as in the main game.  And seriously, if I have to hear the phrase "Turing wept" one more time... but the graphics are beautiful.  And the puzzles.  Oh, the puzzles!			</div>

																This game is amazing.  It's a true first person puzzle game that really has some effort put into it.  All I can say is this development team did not cut corners.  I paid $20 and got 30+ hrs of play time.  The puzzle are challenging enough that's it's just right.  This is where first person puzzle games stand out.  10/10 <br><br>Please make a part 2 of this game!  Well done!			</div>

																+ Concept  (Science and sh*t, you know pal)<br>- everything else<br>- Characters seems Vulgar<br>- Humor is being loud and Vulgar<br>- Story is avrage<br>- Hightech and door don t open automaticly (seems like a small point but if you explore and every door you can go through needs 3 seconds to open (approch the door and look for the pad  and animation ) i got annoyed pretty quickly)<br>- Puzzles are not challanging at all.<br>But i assume if you would trim the fat and get just the good point of the game it would be to short,<br>In general i seem quite hard towards the game and it is correct if there are so much better products out there. If i didn t play something like Portal (as i assume most of people played) this would be quite a nice game but the pacing the puzzles are so lackluster that i does not seem to be worth it.			</div>

																This is by far the longest puzzle game I've seen and it even has two DLCs included which I didn't have the patience any more to complete. But it's also a prime example of how more content isn't always better value.<br><br>First off, the environments are littered with translucent walls as a gameplay element, which is really ugly, and not-quite-invisible walls above every wall, edge or elevated surface you are not supposed to be able to get across because it would invalidate the puzzles, which is just poor design. Even so, apart from the simplest levels in the very first chapter, there is not a single level where there aren't very obvious ways to circumvent at least half the steps/set pieces you are supposed to take/utilize. Most of the time this wasn't faster than the 'correct' path, because it always took me several attempts to get the angle/direction/velocity just right and while in the beginning it was kind of fun to solve the courses in obviously unintended ways it got really tedious later on when the levels become really large and require several dozen needlessly convoluted and often redundant steps to complete, especially once you need to place specific cubes on each pressure plate rather than just any one of them. Somewhat contradictorily, the very techniques that allow you to skip things in earlier levels (mainly jumping over energy walls without deactivating them, which you are generally not supposed to be able to do), are required in some of the later levels.<br><br>On the whole, I would argue the level-design is at the very least inelegant and even borderline incompetent. I rate the game only on the merits of its gameplay elements, but it might bear mentioning that the purpose of the puzzles in-universe was also completely ridiculous and the story itself was cheesy and uninspired, but kind of funny near the end.			</div>

																Общая оценка: 4/10<br><br>Честно, демка выглядела очень вкусно. Сама же игра больше разочаровала. <br>- Слишком много и слишком долго тянется сама игра.<br>- Головоломки явно решаются не так, как задумал разработчик. <br>- Местами эта игра рендом (полет кубика) <br>- гг деревянная на общение<br>- Сюжет бестолковый. Будущие, а безопасности вообще нет. По итогу, гг зачем-то идет к цели через тестовые камеры. Что? Зачем? При чем тут сюжет? Это знаешь, прикинь себе ситуацию: Допустим, горит кресло. Но вместо того, чтобы как минимум взять огнетушитель, а как максимум уйти и вызвать пожарных, ты переводишь взгляд на консоль и такой "а чо, самое время поиграть". Вот такая же тупость с сюжетом происходит в этой игре.			</div>

																I made it to the last section of the game (Jungle) and I have to say, I can't finish it. I am just not interested anymore. I was soldiering on, doing the same kind of puzzle over and over for 15 hours or so and it's just not fun. Compared to Magrunner, I can't often tell if I solved the puzzle right or if I "cheated".<br><br>The puzzle mostly is not "figure out how to do X" but "figure where we hid all the pieces.<br><br>The envinroments are good, the story I didn't care about, the section where you have to go back and forth through endless corridors to reach the next area is an absolute chore. Problem with the environments being scenic is that it obstructs the puzzle. I like that the game tries to steer away from the clean design a'la Portal or Turing Test but I feel like it is to detriment of the gameplay here. It is always disappointing to hit an invisible wall when you feel like you have the right solution.<br><br>It's not a bad game, but it's not very good either - as far as FPS puzzlers go, you can do better and you can do worse.			</div>

																Despite my recommendation, I want to start on a positive note. This game clearly has had a lot of work put into it and I respect that. The environment looks really good and is really well developed, much like the Talos Principle as others say. While the environment design was phenomenal, I can't say the same as much for the puzzles though. <br><br>Most of them are fun, but there are some that left an overwhelmingly negative impression in my mind. Now, I enjoy finding the solution that the developers intend. There are a lot of games that you can either abuse mechanics or come up with a different way to solve the same problem, but I just like finding that clean, methodical solution. Early game, there were some puzzles though that it seemed the intended solution was to abuse mechanics. As another reviewer mentioned, in the late game, individual "chambers" - thinking of Portal's idea of testing chambers - were MASSIVE with lots of moving parts. Some may like that, but I'm not a fan. There are two reasons why. First, it becomes very difficult to find the button, cube or whatever you need to either get started to continue working the puzzle. Second, it is VERY easy to soft lock yourself. Yes, you can reset yourself to the beginning of the chamber, but you lose a lot of progress and it takes time to work through a massive puzzle all over again. I'm no stranger to first person puzzle games and if I go back to those same puzzles later I very well may facepalm and realize the solution was right in front of me but I was just being slow. However, the frustration I felt on account of these previously mentioned reasons is why I cannot recommend this game to others.<br><br>Now I have some additional criticism, but it's very minor compared to everything above. The story. Moves. Very. Slowly. Late game especially, since at that point I generally only heard dialog every other "chamber." Keep in mind, each "chamber" gets larger and larger, taking more and more time to complete, so it can be a while before you hear even just a single sentence from the character you're playing as. Story isn't that important to me - Rethink didn't have a story at all and I still really enjoyed it - but story progression at slightly faster pace would improve it, in my opinion.<br><br>I want to end this review the same way I started - on a positive note. Once again, I appreciate the effort the devs put into this game. The amount of content this game offers is absolutely worth the 20$. I really wish I could recommend it to others because of that. Please do comment if you disagreed with me at any point. A discussion would probably better capture what I really wanted to include in this review anyway.<br><br>This review is somewhat a work in progress - I'll be updating it occasionally as I think of better ways to describe what I'm thinking.			</div>

																<div class="bb_h1">Hui &amp; Pfui!</div><br>Und wiedermal ist es schade, daß es keinen Daumen seitwärts gibt.<br><br>Da mich die Vorschau an diverse Vorgänger der Puzzleszene erinnnerten, habe ich dieses Spiel gekauft. Die Rätsel für sich sind, bis auf wenige Ausnahmen, von anfänglich leicht bis gegen Ende ziemlich schwierig/langwierig. Ausnahmen bilden dabei die Arten von Puzzles, bei denen es auf die richtige Platzierung der Würfel VOR den Kontakten ankommt. Dort beruht die Lösung mehr oder weniger auf dem Zufall, das Rumprobieren nimmt viel Zeit in Anspruch und es baut sich schnell Frust auf. Zum Glück gibt es davon nur wenige.<br><br>Bis hierhin klingt es nach Spaß, wenn da nicht die Abschnitte wären, in denen gesprochen wird. Diese verdarben für mich (fast) das ganze Spiel und ich war heilfroh, wenn ich wieder in den Puzzle-Arealen für mich allein war. Obwohl auch dort vereinzelt zwischen den Puzzles diverse Dialoge zu hören waren. Quasi ununterbrochen wird geflucht, geschimpft und beleidigt, was das Zeug hält. F*ck you hier, F*ck you da, A**hole, s*ck, scr*w you, und so weiter und so fort. Ich weiß nicht, ob es die Entwickler für besonders witzig hielten oder was für Intensionen sie sonst für diese Orgie an Kraftausdrücken hatten. Mich jedenfalls stört es extrem und senkt das Niveau des ansonsten schönen Puzzlespiels.<br><br>Wie gesagt, da es keinen Daumen seitwärts gibt, von mir einen Daumen hoch, da dieses Genre so selten vertreten und die Puzzles ansich zum Denken anregen.			</div>

																tries to be portal with gravity instead of portals. It fails to be the same with several aspects, including using the idea of showing new mechanics then implementing them. Most of the levels take luck to beat the first try and fail to achieve the 'i got it moment'. The story is alright but drags a fair amount with a far amount of filler walking to let the story dialogue go, or for no reason.			</div>

																This game is a breath of fresh air. It's very much in the style of puzzle games, and it hits it out of the park on that front. I've had a lot of experience with these types of games, having played Portal, Portal 2, The Talos Principle, The Witness, The Turing Test, Steamroll, Lightmatter, Q.U.B.E,  The Swapper, Chromagun, The Spectrum Retreat, MIND: Path to Thalmos, Etherborn, Polarity, and Magrunner: Dark Pulse so I feel like I can speak with some leverage in the this particular niche (which happens to be my favorite!)<br><br>You play as a female scientist on a base on the moon. You are trying to get everyone in your crew together but things just don't seem to be going the way you want them to and in order to press forward you have to complete various puzzles. These puzzles typically involve cubes, pressure plates, switches, gravity, anti-gravity and magnetism and you have to use all of them to your advantage to move forward. Early on as the game introduces concepts through puzzles, they easier and quicker to move through. As you progress the puzzles in Relicta become challenging almost, at times, to the point of frustration, but very satisfying to solve and totally reasonable when you realize what you are supposed to do. The breadth of some of the levels makes them take quite a bit of time to both analyze, set up a plan, and implement it. Occasionally the implementation of your ideas does not function right and you have to try repeatedly to accomplish what you want to do (or give up on that method), but the game does a good job of allowing easy ways to get your cubes back as well as an easy way to restart a particular puzzle if you need to. I was particularly impressed with some of the really unique ways that Relicta has you solve parts of puzzles. When I made the discovery of how to do these particular things, it felt so incredible. You have to really think outside the box! Since I would describe this game as a puzzler, I wanted this to be the first thing I discussed.<br><br>The graphics of the game are good. Each area of puzzles has it's own beautiful biome style and they are impressive. I was a bit disappointed that I couldn't explore as much as I'd like due to the invisible walls. I particularly liked the jungle biome and I liked the sounds for it too.<br><br>The game runs smooth at about 80-100 fps with my GTX 980. I have not had any bugs and the game seems well polished.<br><br>The voice acting is good, but I wouldn't call it outstanding.<br><br>I was not too happy about all the crude language in this game so, fair warning, you're not going to want to play it around kids at least during the times you are travelling because that's when the dialogue happens. Every game I've played in this style has managed to do it with little to no cussing from what I remember, but this game excessively uses it in my opinion.<br><br>The one other gripe I have is with the travelling. Travelling from place to place through the main area and the other world areas was really kind of difficult. Half the time I didn't seem to know exactly where to go and had to just stumble around. It would be nice to have some sort of arrow to direct you where it wants you to go so you can get there - there are just so many ways to go. That said, the game does have hidden PDA notes and some collectibles hidden throughout the worlds, which is nice.<br><br>I forget where I made the discovery of Relicta initially, but I am glad I decided to pick it up. Typically I don't buy a game at full price, but I did with this one knowing the style of game it was and I have to say it had totally been worth that amount of money. Based on what I know about the game, I'm guessing I am a little over halfway through it at the time of this review and have put in 12 hours. The story has kept me interested in what is yet to come, and I can't wait to know what the ending is going to be. For very few people working on this game, I am very impressed with the quality of it. It's hard to find a good game in this vein, but this is definitely one of them.			</div>

																Relicta is a first person puzzle game that really wants to be Portal.<br><br>Like all such games, it falls well short.<br><br>But unfortunately, it doesn’t even manage to stand out particularly as its own thing. Despite its high graphical fidelity and production quality, it starts out promising but ends up falling apart about halfway through, both in terms of gameplay and story.<br><br>Like all such games, it has a “core mechanic”. The core mechanic here is the ability to give blocks (and some pads that can hold charges) either a red charge or a blue charge. Opposite colored charges attract, same-colored charges repel.<br><br>In addition, you can make blocks weightless, allowing them to fly through the air after having been given a push from a charge, or continuing on their momentum from a moving platform.<br><br>That’s it. That’s all there is.<br><br>The game is entirely centered around grabbing blocks and putting them on buttons to get rid of various force fields blocking your way, and sometimes toggling the odd switch. The force fields can either block everything, or only one thing – you, blocks, or drones.<br><br>There are some platforms that you can move, along with some drones that remove all special effects on all nearby blocks and charge pads, and which can carry blocks.<br><br>And… that’s all the mechanics there is.<br><br>The problem is, this is a 15 hour long game, but it has fewer, and less interesting, mechanics than something like Portal 2.<br><br>So how does it make the game last 15 hours?<br><br>Unfortunately, the answer to that is by just making increasingly long puzzles in the back half of the game. Frequently, puzzles would either be multi-stage things, where you go through a series of mini-puzzles, or a puzzle where there was some sort of “hub” that you kept on having to solve mini-puzzles to unlock a central door. Only rarely were there big puzzles that actually felt like they integrated all the pieces.<br><br>As a result, the entire second half of the game starts to end up feeling tedious rather than interesting. Some of the later game puzzles were okay, but never was there a puzzle in the game where I felt like it was particularly amazing to solve. A lot of the “harder” puzzles were harder because you couldn’t find a particular “puzzle piece”, so to speak; once you actually had the pieces in hand, what you were actually supposed to do was often fairly straightforward, if sometimes fiddly later in the game, as you had to line things up rather awkwardly to make some puzzles work, as the “snap-to” portions didn’t work in some areas due to them not sending you in quite the right direction or being aligned in the right way.<br><br>The game ends up just kind of dragging on by the end, and I just wanted it to be over.<br><br>Which brings up the other problem – the story.<br><br>It starts out promisingly enough – there’s some sort of inciting incident with a weird purple crystal, you have a set of coworkers around and a daughter who is coming to the space station, ect.<br><br>The problem is, this all ends up falling apart about halfway through the game. The central plot twist of the game isn’t very good and results in almost all of the characters you spent the first half of the game talking with never talking to you again throughout the rest of the game. As a result, the game's supporting cast dynamics end up being totally tossed out the window and not mattering at all for the rest of the game, as you end up interacting with a second, and less interesting, set of characters for the second half of the game.<br><br>Indeed, if you spend any time thinking about the plot twist, it both feels unnecessarily convoluted and makes no physical sense, nor sense with the other characters in the story, who act like no time has passed at all. The loss of contact with their former colleagues gets short shrift and the story itself seems to forget about what happened to them, as the characters don’t seem to care despite supposedly being emotionally invested. Only at the very end of one of the game’s two multiple endings (which are chosen at the last minute for… some reason? I don’t even know why it has multiple endings…) does the game remember “Oh, these people existed” and actually follow up on it at all, and then only in a stinger thing that is not very satisfying (though there’s more from a title update I have yet to play).<br><br>Overall, then, the game fails to deliver in terms of story, character, or gameplay. The story doesn’t even make a ton of sense in terms of characterization, and the gameplay is too simple for a game as long as Relicta is. Despite a potentially promising start, it just doesn’t hold up, and it never really does anything particularly good, let alone great.<br>			</div>

																If you enjoyed puzzle games like Portal, Talos Principle, you'll like this one too. The puzzle difficulty curve was also very well planned out, and there were manymore puzzles than I was expecting for the price! There is a story happening, but it could be better at connecting with the puzzle route.			</div>

																Einsatzbericht: 5799310 Datum: 06/08/20    Einsatzleiter/in: Dr. Angelica Patel<br><br>In den letzten 10-15 Stunden war ich aufgrund verschiedenster teschnicher Störungen gezwungen, in der als Mana III bekannten Basis auf dem Mond in verschiedensten künstlich generierten Biomen mithilfe der Testobjekte (Gravitationshandschuhe) eine Unmenge an zum teil äußerst schwierigen auf den physikalischen Gesetzen der Gravitation beruhenden Rätsel zu lösen. Sys hatte während besagter Zeit leider einige schwerwiegende Fehlfunktionen, weshalb das vorankommen sich an manchen Stellen als schwierig gestaltet. Zudem musste ich manchmal aufgrund von Schäden an einzelnen Rätseln einen neuen Ansatz suchen, jedoch kann ich nun im Nachhinein sagen, dass der Einsatz ein voller Erfolg war und ich hoffe weitere Feldeinsätze auf Mana III leiten zu dürfen.<br><br>P.S Alami ich zähle darauf dass sie wieder mit von der Partie sind.			</div>

																Relicta is a beautiful puzzle game that reminded me portal and the talos principle. You are in space in a facility, where inside it there are test rooms that you travel with puzzles and every new room/region have a new concept(jungle, desert etv) There is a story and it's ok, a bit of humor and it tries to get you involved with the other characters (voices only), but never feel the conection. The game have amazing graphics and have stunning landscapes, i found myself just staring at the different enviroments in each room. It took me around 11 hours to finish (100%) the main game, without me trying the new 2 bonus  adventures that was added on April.<br><br>In the game you are moving some cubes and place them to the correct places so you can proceed, with the help of a glove that gives possitive and negative polarity and gravity. The puzzles are kinda difficult and i would not say that is an easy puzzle game, but it was fun, and when i had a chance to spare 1-2 hours i would open it and play it. In general suggest this game, maybe not full price (not that high tbh), but for sure in sales.<br><br>Το relicta είναι ένα πολύ όμορφο παιχνίδι γρίφων που θυμίζει λίγο μίξη portal και talos principle. Βρίσκεσαι στο διάστημα μέσα σε μια πειραματική εγκατάσταση, όπου εντός αυτής μεταφέρεσαι σε νέα δωμάτια-κόσμους που έχουν φτιαχτεί με διάφορους γρίφους και όλο αυτό(κάθε περιοχή) περιβάλλεται από ένα διαφορετικό τοπίο που έχουν φτιάξει(ζούγκλα, έρημος κτλ). Υπάρχει ιστορία η οποία είναι συμπαθητική, έχει λίγο χιούμορ, προσπαθεί κιόλας να σε κάνει να δεθείς με τους χαρακτήρες (μόνο φωνές) αλλά δε το πολύ πετυχαίνει κατά τη γνώμη μου. Το παιχνίδι από άποψη γραφικών και τοπίων ήταν αρκετά όμορφο και περιποιημένο και βρήκα τον εαυτό μου απλά να χαζεύω το περιβάλλον στα δωμάτια με τους γρίφους. Μου πήρε κάτι λιγότερο από 11 ώρες για να βγάλω 100% το main παιχνίδι χωρίς να έχω ασχοληθεί με 2 μπόνους&nbsp;ιστορίες με άλλους χαρακτήρες όπου προστέθηκαν τον Απρίλιο.<br><br>Στο παιχνίδι στην ουσία μεταφέρεις κύβους και τοποθετώντας τους στα σωστά σημεία έχοντας σαν “όπλο” ένα γάντι που δίνει είτε θετική είτε αρνητική πολικότητα και την την ιδιότητα της βαρύτητας. Οι γρίφοι μπορώ να πω πως είναι κάπως δύσκολοι σε αρκετά σημεία και γενικά δε θα το χαρακτήριζα σχετικά εύκολο, αλλά ήταν ένα ωραίο παιχνίδι, όποτε έβρισκα ένα κενό χρόνο 1-2 ωρών που μπορούσα να αφιερώσω σε κάποιο παιχνίδι δε το σκεφτόμουν και το έπιανα. Γενικά, ήταν ένα παιχνίδι που θα το πρότεινα, ίσως όχι στην κανονική τιμή(αν και δεν είναι πολύ ψηλά 20), αλλά σίγουρα σε έκπτωση.			</div>

																I had to think about this rating a lot, and in the end I have to say I don't recommend it by a hair's width. <br><br>Relicta is a pretty good 3D puzzle game. The obvious comparison is PORTAL, but instead of portals, you have the powers of magnetism &amp; turning gravity on or off. And instead of damaging obstacles, you have like 8 types of barriers. It's not a bad game, but it has two massive, and I mean MASSIVE problems.<br><br><b> 1) When you walk into a room, you have to spend several minutes running around trying to figure out where everything is and  what your goal even is. </b> There's no clear exit marker or special color for the final barrier you need to deactivate, and the beautiful nature environments actually make this worse because there's a lot of visual clutter. The visual clutter gets progressively worse each area, as a new color of holographic light is added for the new mechanic. And finally, because some of these puzzles have verticality / multiple floors, you literally can't see half the map until you solve half the puzzle, and then go "oh" and have to restart and do something different. <br><br><b> 2) The physics simulation(s) and hitboxes are not nice to you. </b> First off, they appear to be locked to framerate (bad), and second, the margin of error allowed in most of these puzzles is super low, way too low: you can do everything right but somehow fall off a box, or get bounced slightly in the wrong direction, bump a ceiling, walk too close to a ledge, etc. and bam! Retry it all! Go set everything up for the solution for another 4 minutes :) There are several puzzles that I've basically completed, only to bump a ceiling somehow, or otherwise get knocked back to the start, repeatedly, for no discernable reason. I think another issue is that, because of the gravity-type repulsive forces, objects tend to move very quickly which seems to make some puzzles much harder than they should be. I don't really know how to explain that the physics of the game just don't feel right. They're too realistic for a puzzle game but not realistic enough for a hyper-realistic sim game. <br><br>To conclude, while the puzzles are fun and quite difficult, most of the difficulty actually comes from the game's puzzle setups being annoying and convoluted, as well as the practice of knowing what hitbox jank to avoid. It's a beautiful game, and the mechanics are cool, but I just can't recommend it because it feels like half the game isn't solving puzzles at all, it's just fighting with the game engine or confusedly running through buildings. <br><br>Story wise, it's quite good, with the exception that there's zero reason to solve all the puzzles. I don't care if it's a "computer glitch" there's no way literally every inch of this planet has been filled with energy walls and high powered magnets and boxes with no shutoff.  Nobody besides the player character even has the ability to do the magnetism thing! This is a futuristic space station and they have -2 contingency plans, so when things go wrong our very intelligent scientist friends just decide to solve the puzzles anyways while people are actively freezing to death.			</div>

																Is a decent puzzle game. But not great.<br>Graphics are just ok. Music is rare, but fits the game. <br>Story is serviceable. But dialogs are poorly written. <br>Puzzles offer a decent challenge. But a several are dependent on physics and sometimes don't work at the first try, nor the second, nor the third. So you have to keep repeating, until the physics engine does what it's supposed to do.			</div>

																Phenomenal first-person puzzle game. There was some jank flying on boxes, but not enough to deter me from finishing or recommending this game. For what it's worth, the game ran pretty well on my old toaster of a desktop but turned my PC into a space heater, raising the temperature of my office a few degrees in the process.			</div>

																It's a bunch of timing puzzles, and if you miss the timing you end up starting over because some box is unrecoverable, or the price for failing just puts the box back at the start.  So you tediously do things twice to figure out the timing.			</div>

																Szeretem a puzzle játékokat, de egy puzzle játék legyen változatos. Itt végig hülye kockákat kell rakni A-ból B-be. Az igaz hogy azért vannak fejtörő feladatok ( persze szintén a kockákkal ) de egy egész játékot ezzel tölteni, elég unalmas. A látvány szép, talán a story is jó lehet, csak a játék menet lehetne sokkal változatosabb. Ennél vannak jobb / izgalmasabb játékok olcsóbban   is, kár erre pénzt/energiát áldozni.<br><br>Hasonló kategóriájú jó játékot keresel, tudom ajánlani :<br>- Story About my uncle <br>- Valley			</div>

																Sehr schöner Puzzle-Plattformer mit einer spannenden Story und sehr realistischen Dialogen, die auch alle sehr gut auf Englisch synchronisiert sind. Wunderschöne Umgebung für ein Puzzle-Spiel.<br><br>Ein paar Dinge muss ich jedoch kritisieren: <br>- Zum einen bietet das Spiel zwar die Möglichkeit einen tobii Eyetracker zu verwenden, doch leider funktioniert das nicht so wirklich oder ich mache etwas falsch.<br>- Die Dialoge sind zwar gut, aber ich hätte mir noch ein paar mehr Reaktionen auf die Umgebung gewünscht, wie zum Beispiel auf die zerstörten Gänge, die zu den Puzzles führen.<br>- Nach einigen Stunden Spielzeit läuft der RAM über, weil anscheinend die zuvor absolvierten Puzzle noch geladen sind. Ein kurzes Neustarten hilft in so einer Situation.<br><br>Kurze Zusammenfassung: Sehr gutes Spiel und auch das Geld wert, könnte aber noch ein paar Funktions-Updates bekommen.			</div>

																Decent 1st person puzzle game with some enjoyable spins on mechanic without really breaking any new ground if you have played any of the pillars of the genre. Nice, if shallow, premise that meshes reasonably well with the central conceit that all of these games have to ignore/confront: Why am I doing this set of self-contained puzzles? Interesting characters with good voice acting even if that side is also not explored much. Idea of locations are clever although in execution bit generic space station/forest/desert and a bit too much trudging without anything of note happening. Most of the puzzles are grokkable with a handful of tedious ones that overstay the point where you know what to do but have to wait for timings to align.			</div>

																I typically like puzzle games, but this one doesn't work for me.<br>The riddles are just tedious. You need to move boxes from A to B pressing buttons to unlock your way or you ride on the boxes to your next riddle. Pretty early on, the levels get too big to have a good overview. You run around a few minutes to figure out the layout, where to get the boxes and where to move them. This just feels completely unnecessary.<br>Then the riddles themselves involve just simple push pull mechanics, sometimes with kind of a dexterity check because you need to change polarity on the fly.<br>Solving the riddles feels really unrewarding. You don't feel any sense of accomplishment, just another tedious section done.<br><br>And then there is the voice acting. The indian accent gets pretty annoying after just minutes.<br><br>If you're looking for a cool innovative puzzle game, I'd recommend "Lightmatter" or "the Touring Test" but not this one.			</div>

																While it's a perfectly fine block-puzzle game, all of these supposedly brilliant characters are incredibly stupid.<br><br>Also, if the dumpster-fire that is Twitter is still relevant enough to be referenced by someone in the year 2120, then humanity deserves what it gets.			</div>

	</div>
</div><br>This review is a truncated version based on the upper character limit for Steam reviews. For the full version, watch the video.<br><br>In essence, Relicta fits the term “first-person physics puzzler” about as well as you could imagine: It’s mostly about moving blocks through levels in order to hold down buttons or transport you around. Both things are achieved by what the game calls magnetism, because apparently the cubes and plates you can operate are made of magnetic materials, but honestly, it seems more like you’re able to just manipulate gravity itself even beyond mere magnetism. I say this mostly because the main attraction/repulsion mechanic is actually expanded with a third option that allows you to cancel out downward gravity altogether in order to fling these cubes around without them falling to the ground, so both types of manipulation do similar things.<br><br>The game is overall structured in a handful of zones spanning a couple of biomes on a moon base, where each zone introduces a new obstacle in a handful of enclosed “test chambers” that you must overcome with the use of your basic powers, which stay the same over the entire length of the game. So while at first you only have to figure out ways to traverse these levels with the aforementioned cubes and mounted plates by giving them a polarity to either attract or repel each other, later challenges introduce switch puzzles, moving platforms, shifting scenery and flying drones that cancel out any polarity you’ve set, so there is a variety of interactions the game gets out of its simple mechanic.<br><br>And to the game’s credit, it never overcomplicates these additional mechanics. A trap I’ve seen very often in these types of puzzle games that build up in complexity while maintaining a simple basic core of mechanics is that some think throwing in every conceivable obstacle at the player in a single level is a good idea. So it’s usually a sign of quality and that the developer really thought about the challenge curve of their game if they manage to avoid this pitfall.<br><br>However, the game falls into another pitfall that ended up frustrating me at certain parts. As the term “physics-puzzler” implies, the game relies on physics interactions. And one of the most important aspects of a game that relies on physics interactions as part of its core mechanics is that the physics must be predictable and repeatable. And unfortunately, that isn’t always the case. So while you can set up your blocks and plates in a way that make you think whatever you’re attempting is going to succeed, if the physics system decides to not play ball, you can sometimes lose all progress of any given test chamber through no fault of your own and you have to reset it.<br><br>While resetting is not that big of a deal in the beginning, because the challenges are all short and snappy, it can cause you to tear your hair out in later stages. Later test chambers are actually multi-stage puzzles, where in order to gather the cubes to move on to the next chamber, you’ll first have to figure out how to get these cubes to the main area of the chamber in the first place. And if the physics system craps itself just before that final hurdle, you’ll have to do the entire thing from the top again, which just isn’t fun. Because at that point, you’re not solving a puzzle, you’re just executing a solution. A proper save-system that saves this kind of progress would’ve been very welcome during some of the later levels.<br><br>You might have noticed that I mostly focused on the gameplay aspect and haven’t mentioned the story in the slightest here. And that’s because I don’t really think there’s much to say about the story. It’s a fairly generic little tale about a moon colony getting taken over by the titular alien artifact that’s also responsible for giving you the ability to control magnetism and gravity. Most of the narrative happens over the phone because modelling, rigging and animating people is hard, so don’t expect to interact with people face to face. The story is also mostly told at you through not that great voice-acting and your character is either ordered to go somewhere to do something or decides on their own to go somewhere and do something. As it happens, “going somewhere and doing something” always means passing through one of the test tracks littered with the test chambers. So in essence, the whole puzzle aspect, even though it’s initially caused by the MacGuffin du jour, has absolutely no overlap with the narrative. It even goes so far that the main character points out that everything they have to do is always on the far side of one of the test tracks that can’t be circumvented for some convenient reason, so the gameplay actively interferes with the narrative instead of complementing it.<br><br>I didn’t particularly enjoy these kinds of fourth wall breaks where the game highlights the tedium of trying to move on with whatever you’re attempting to do while constantly being roadblocked by what should be the main attraction of the game. It highlights a certain disconnect in what the game thinks people show up for, because if you include a narrative that makes fun of the gameplay it forces the player to endure and makes it seem like the most tedious aspect of the game, you might end up causing players to ask themselves why they’re even playing a game that makes fun of what players who like puzzle games show up for. And in fact it did cause me to resent the later sections of the game, because the new mechanics they introduce aren’t used in varied and novel ways, you’re just expected to solve five or six challenges that involve the same mechanics, but they almost never ask you to apply the principles you’ve just learned in the first level of any given section in alternate ways in later puzzles, so they literally turn out to be roadblocks I wished I didn’t have to endure on my way to wrap up the narrative.<br><br>Between the puzzle sections, you have to walk through empty parts of the moon base that are built out of endlessly copypasted segments that all look the same. You can explore a few of the crew quarters, communal areas and laboratories, but there’s no real visual storytelling going on anywhere, it’s just a stereotypical sterile sci-fi environment. The only background lore you can pick up on is communicated through collectibles that you have to go out of your way and find. It sets up this needlessly complex backstory of how these various non-Terran colonies went through revolutions, fights for independence and how they’re currently under a not too favorable administration, which is why the team working at your base must conceal any knowledge about the Relicta seeping out from the colony. <br><br>Honestly, the game just couldn’t manage to make me give a sh<i></i>it about either the setting or the story it tried to tell and the story actively made me not really look forward to doing the later puzzles because my payoff would just be more badly voice-acted narrative steeped in this terribly overwrought and yet still ill-defined setting. Unfortunately, I can’t really recommend Relicta, not even to fans of physics-puzzlers. The basic gameplay is interesting and while I certainly had fun with some of the puzzles, its overall execution leaves to be desired and the narrative lives in this entirely separate world from the gameplay and it’s just not an interesting tale worth telling. I think a good indicator whether the game was worth playing is provided with the fact that the game contains two additional campaigns, one of which takes place after the narrative of the main game and I didn’t even bother playing either of the two, because I honestly had more than enough after finishing the main game.			</div>

																15+ hours of mice puzzle gameplay.  Lot's of interesting mechanics introduced gradually throughout the game with a nice learning curve.  There is a somewhat interesting plot, although, not directly related to the gameplay.  A solid recommendation.			</div>

																I don't know if I'm seeing things, but I swear every time I go though the main hub, it's just *slightly* different. Like a potted plant has changed to a different, similar plant or some similar change. And considering certain events that I won't spoil, that fits PERFECTLY!<br><br>I don't care if it's not actually happening and I'm just not noticing certain details until a later trip through, This game is perfectly playing my paranoia, without making me feel threatened! Just puzzles, no real danger. Just keep doing those tests. It's fine. Keep testing. Everything is fine. We can wait for you to finish the tests. We can wait for you to join us...			</div>

																IMO this is one of the better puzzlers out there. It has a surprisingly engaging plot and probably a higher quantity of puzzles than any other game I've played. The mechanics allow for a surprisingly large amount of diversity in challenges, but still some of the puzzles were repetitive and others felt like I solved them incorrectly.<br><br>I also appreciate the protagonist being an Indian female, an incredibly under-represented group (I'm pretty sure this is the only game I know of that this is the case). The scenery and environment was also absolutely beautiful.<br><br>Overall, I definitely recommend. You get a lot of game for the price, and the puzzles and plot were definitely well made and engaging. I don't consider it the best puzzle game I've ever played, but it's among the greats.			</div>

																Достойное место среди головоломок от первого лица. Прозрачные стены (про которые иногда говорят) совершенно не напрягали и я предпочту их и отличный вид, чем сплошные завалы, чтобы не пройти. Да и сделаны они уместно.<br>Сами головоломки не сильно сложные, но в конце игры и легкими я бы их тоже не называл. Головоломок много, игра не короткая.<br>Уровни проработаны отлично, как и графика в целом. Гулять по лунной базе тоже классно.<br>Могу придраться только к отсутствию сохранения в любой точке, но, на удивление, с этим, на самом деле, проблем не было абсолютно.<br>Словом, через годик-другой, когда решения слегка забудутся пройду игру еще раз.			</div>

																In Relicta, you play a woman who's a scientist on the moon. In the biospheres there (ice, desert, jungle ...) she has to test her gravitational gloves which are bades on an artifact.<br>And that's the first minus: The tests that you play are not about the gloves, they are about your ability to solve puzzles. So that story premise makes no sense.<br>Next thing: something happens, she has to get from A to B. Too bad, that there are more test hindering her on the way. So the tests are presented as a nuisance to the player ...<br>And why the hell would you build the test in the way where you have to move from A to B without any possible way around? <br>This makes not a single bit of sense as other characters have moved to the place I need to go, but I'm the only one with the gravitational gloves.<br><br>That's basically the whole story. OK, there is a bit more to it. The story is only told in uninteractive dialogue after completed tests. Only at a handful of points there are short wannabe-ingame-cinematics.<br><br>Between the tests you often have to take the maglev-train. And that's where you have to walk through empty train stations. (well there are some emails &amp; logs left to find, but that's all you can do in the train stations.<br><br>Where in portal you have the e´levator, walk 5 meters and are in the next puzzle room, here you have 3 loading screens, 2 to ~5 doors to walk through, an 'enter the train' animation that has potential to annoy as a time-waster and you always have go to a table with a holographic map to set your destination.<br><br>Sometimes it feels like 50% walking to the next level and 50% playing that level.<br><br>That being said about the story - the gameplay of the puzzles is fun.<br><br>You've got the typical cubes and switches to put them on. You've got the gloves that can magnetize the cubes and certain surfaces. You've got walls for you or the cube. Sometimes you can mark a cube and then teleport it to a teleport exit. Mash all that together and you can generate many maps from that.<br><br>There is a "story walkthrough" video that is shorter than 5 hours, but that's only when you know the solutions already. I needed 20+ hours for my first playthrough.<br>Finding the solutions is fair. It's mostly 'see what you CAN do and do it'. New puzzle elements and their function are easily recognizable.<br><br>TL;DR: Gameplay is fun, but prepare for tedious walking between the puzzles. Forget the story.<br><br>Quality level: Magrunner. <br>Portal and Talos Principle are out of reach for this one.			</div>

																<div class="bb_h1">Note: This downvote is in lieu of a "middle" rating since Steam does not have those.  I do not hate this game, but I have stuff to say about it.</div><br>This game reminds me of several other games in the FPP genre:<br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Portal and Portal 2: because of course.  Any game where you place boxes onto pressure plates is bound to have this comparison.<br></li><li>Q.U.B.E., and in particular Q.U.B.E. 2: the Relicta ("thing") <span class="bb_spoiler"><span>is highly reminiscent of the sentient Q.U.B.E. from said series</span></span>, in addition to the player's gloves always being visible during puzzle solving.  Also some of the gameplay mechanics kinda reminded me of those in the Q.U.B.E. series (mostly the magnetism mechanic).<br></li><li>The Swapper (which technically is not a first-person game, but it is a puzzle game): only slightly, but for similar reasons as above.<br></li><li>The Talos Principle: length and depth of puzzle design, as well as the puzzles taking place in (semi-)artificial natural environments.<br></li><li>The Turing Test: narrative and atmosphere.  Both take place in futuristic, sci-fi-style space, with high-tech labs and whatnot.  Arguably though, despite the semi-immature swearing, the narrative in Relicta comes across as more genuine and has more character than that of The Turing Test.  However, overall the story of Relicta feels half-baked.</li></ul>In addition, <span class="bb_spoiler"><span>the game tries to do the two-ending-last-minute-choice thing that Q.U.B.E. 2, The Swapper, and The Turing Test all tried to do.  For such a linear game with an underdeveloped narrative, it's actually... rather underwhelming.  Neither of the Portal games nor Q.U.B.E. needed them to have a sufficiently satisfying ending, and The Talos Principle managed its endings quite well.</span></span><br><br>Being an Unreal Engine game, it looks pretty (<a class="bb_link" href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2565671299" target="_blank" rel="">well, 99% anyway</a>).  The boundary control is decent — not too many rock walls to gate the player (like in many games), yet parts of the environments (sometimes intentionally) look contrived for the sake of gameplay.  The sound design is nice — borderline immersive even (but why are there no footstep sounds at Chandra base?).  The music however, is... actually kinda lacking and samey, particularly during puzzle solving.  I get it — too dramatic, and players will feel distracted, but a little variety would be nice (either that, or omit the music entirely, like in The Witness, and parts of Portal and Portal 2).<br><br>Controls are fine — standard Portal-style FPP controls.  In fact I never really needed or used the sprint feature.  The hard part for me was trying not to get my mental wires crossed when it came to the cube polarity (and remembering to switch on anti-gravity), but that was to be expected.  The game feels OK to play, but if you're feeling "boxed in" or get motion sick, try disabling motion blur, head bobbing, and/or setting the field of view to at least 100.<br><br>The puzzle design is nice — good flow (which actually makes them feel more like convolutions than puzzles), conceptually not too taxing (meaning it's fairly accessible even to non-veterans of the puzzle game genre), and even if you can't always see where to go, you can always suss it out, so in due time you won't feel too overwhelmed.<br><br>For the former half of the game, the puzzles feel clean.  As the game progresses however (particularly by the second part of Sverdrup beach), it begins to look messier, and a few elements even become redundant in certain puzzles.  There are lots of semi-blinding fields (similar to Portal 2's Emancipation Grills), some of which tastelessly have no border.  I think the devs tried to follow a little in the footsteps of The Talos Principle in this regard; however, more complex puzzles ≠ better or more difficult puzzles.<br><br>Relicta has "puzzle checkpointing", where you press a switch to make the puzzle more comfortable to progress through.  The issue with puzzle checkpointing is that it's almost never automatic, but even with this in place, there is still a degree of softlocking, where a cube will sometimes float out of place, get stuck on some inaccessible obstacle, and force the need for a whole tedious puzzle to be reset.<br><br>The main mechanics and puzzle areas have a narrative explanation, but they're even weaker than those of The Turing Test.  This creates the problem of separating out the narrative from the gameplay (granted, the narrative pacing is at least better than, say, TRI: Of Friendship and Madness).  This is a problem because the puzzles in the latter half of the game feel even more like a purposeless chore (NB The Talos Principle also suffered from much the same problem — once you get to the red sigils in that game, it can feel a little like a slog — but at least many of the puzzles aren't overly daunting in that game).<br><br><b>Update:</b> I have now finished both extras (Aegir Gig and Ice Queen).  While the above exactly applies to Aegir Gig (except with a slightly more confusing story), Ice Queen is an improvement on story and music.  However everything else remains the same.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Lastly, there's a voice in this game that sounds a lot like Jim Sterling doing a fake ad for Creedle &amp; Crabnuts.			</div>

																Other reviews are already better than what I could write, so I'll just keep it short.  Overall, if you like Portal or other Portal-likes, it's a reasonably fun and challenging game.  It seems to run on a bit long and is a bit repetitive at times.  Also, you'll find yourself solving levels without using all the magnets and stuff that were laid out, so either there are intentionally a bunch of red herrings placed throughout the game, or a lot of ways to cut corners and dodge stuff.  The game usually avoids letting you get yourself trapped, but it's still possible occasionally, meaning you have to hold down R and reset all progress to redo the level up to that point.  Luckily that's pretty rare.<br><br>I guess that's enough rambling.  I wish some of the other Portal-likes I played were as decent as this one.			</div>

																The Talos Principle. Принцип Талоса, Талоса принцип... Две этих замечательных головоломки очень похожи.<br>Хотела опубликовать обзор на такую классную игру сразу после прохождения, но, чтобы это сделать, пришлось переворачиваться с ног наголову и пытаться сидеть на стене, пока вся королевская конница и вся королевская рать...<br>Мне очень понравились головоломки, особенно в конце. Игра не позволяет расслабляться: масса переключателей и пластин в каждом puzzl'e обязывает исследовать технику передачи объектов для выхода из головоломки снова и снова. То есть, невозможно сразу обозреть из одной точки прохождение игровой области. Именно эта трудность меня привлекла.<br>Неожиданно обнаружила после сюжета новые комнаты испытаний, относящиеся, очевидно, к  другой истории.<br>И  это удивительно, что я узнала об "Реликте" только в 2023. И когда купила ключ, еще не подозревала, какой подарок меня ждет			</div>

																<b>명작까지는 아니지만 퀄리티 높은, 좋은 게임입니다. 퍼즐 플랫포머 좋아한다면 할인할 때 사서 해 보세요. </b><br><br><b>퍼즐 플랫포머로써의 정체성이 잘 살아있는 게임.</b> 퍼즐에 사용되는 장애물이 다양해서 머리를 꽤나 써야 하고, 자기장과 중력을 이용하는 만큼 가속도나 힘의 작용 방향 같은 물리적인 부분까지 고려해야 하면서도 게임이니까 감으로 하면 됩니다.<br><b>플레이타임도 길고 그만큼 퍼즐도 많습니다.</b> 그러면서도 재미없을 정도로 쉽거나 머리 터지게 어렵지 않도록 난이도 조절을 잘 해놨고요. 퍼즐이 복잡해 보이지만 일단 달려들면 풀립니다. 팁 하나 적자면, 큐브를 올려놓으면 딱 들어맞을 것 같은 나무판이 바닥에 있다면 큐브를 올려놔 보세요. <br><b>게임 더빙과 번역 퀄리티도 좋습니다.</b>특히 욕이 개찰져요. System, you digital ♥♥♥♥!<br><br>아쉬웠던 점은 게임 분량이나 주제에 비해서 <b>엔딩이 너무 빈약하다는 거.</b> 엔딩에서도 플레이어가 능동적으로 뭔가를 할 수 있거나 좀 더 강렬한 연출을 보여줬다면 좋았을 겁니다. <br><b>그리고 저장 기능도 불편합니다.</b>게임이 어렵고 뒤로 가면 퍼즐 하나하나가 길어지는데, 저장은 무조건 퍼즐 하나를 완전히 깨야만 저장되도록 되어 있습니다. 그것도 세이브파일은 딱 하나만. 다 깨고 나서 원하는 부분만 선택해서 플레이할 수도 없고, 무조건 처음부터입니다. <br><br>부족한 점이 좀 있지만 그래도 재밌는 게임. 할인하면 사서 해 보세요.			</div>

																Excellent Cube-n-Button based physics based puzzle platformer, decent story and a large amount of puzzles that will leave you head scratching, even for someone as experienced as me. I've logged 11 hours as of this review and will continue to log many more after this review. Has a very nice difficult curve that doesn't get too difficult to quickly, but also doesn't waste your time teaching you all the super beginner puzzles. Not reccomended for starting out, see Portal / Portal 2 if you want the creme da la creme.			</div>

																As someone who only just recently realized the PDA serves as a quest tracker and is notoriously unwilling to pay attention to any given storyline, finding my way to the respective puzzle next in line appeared to pose the biggest, as well as most tedious, challenge yet. Until I, to my own astonishment, found myself absorbed in the ongoings of Chandra, which also significantly relieved my directional confusion. Legit one of the most entertaining ingame dialogue styles I’ve come across in years...can't help but love the latest addition to the crew.<br><br>+ Diversified and generally great level design<br>+ Original approach to the 3D puzzle theme<br>+ Progressive complexity<br>+ Amusing and captivating Story<br><br>Go get it, pronto<br>			</div>

																I have played, but not completed the game and don't think I will reach the end, but still I recommend it.<br><br>The reason for not finishing this game is that I personally have found that I do not enjoy first person puzzle games that much, however I will not put that as a slight against the game as from what I have played (half way through) the puzzles are good and get increasingly more complex and hard as the game goes on. I found not noticeable hikes in difficulty, but rather a steady increase in difficulty. I would also say this game is harder then Portal 1, but seems to be heading towards the difficulty of some of the later areas of Portal 2.<br><br>The story was the most enjoyable aspect of the game for me and I liked the world building and lore, it did not just exist as a backdrop or justification for the puzzles.<br><br>The Characters where enjoyable. The environments are good enough for the story and puzzles.			</div>

																Relicta doesn't make the best of first impressions but quickly makes up for that with satisfying game play mechanics and well crafted physics.<br>Voice acting ranges from adequate to good and the dialogue strikes a neat balance between serious and funny.<br>The story/game play balance is also good, delivering portions of the story at the end of each puzzling session.<br><br>Overall, Relicta is a well made experience more than worthy of it's price tag.			</div>

																<div class="bb_h1"> If i can think of it, i can create it - Symetra </div> <br>Relicta has filled the void in my heart that The Talos Principle left me with after i have finished the game. Finally a truely awesome Puzzlegame, mixed with an interesting setting, beautiful looks and fitting soundtracks! <br><br>But before i just overwhelm this review with praise lets look at the details and let me explain, why i like this game so much. <br><br><b> Setting </b> <br>You play this game as a scientist who is altering gravitiy with some new future technology and uses it to overcome puzzle levels to study the limits of this technology. You are playing this on Habitats that were created on the moon itself! And if you are woundering, why a scientist should basicly play puzzlelevels...on moonhabitats, that look like Forests, Icefields or Sand Deserts...well there is a very good explanation to it! <br><br>But i dont want to spoiler it for you so only a few words: The lore in this game is really interesting. Over my lifetime i have played i guess over a thousends of games and i have to say i never saw an sci-fi universe like this before! The storys of what is going on, how the world outside of the game looks, and why there are habitats like this on the moon is really interesting and refreshingly new! I personally was just a bit sad, because since the world is so interesting i would love to learn more about it, that what you learn from the data-logs you collect on the way. <br><br><b> Gameplay </b><br>Now let us come to the main element of this game: The puzzles!  There are in my opinion two type of puzzle games. There are those like Myst, where you have no idea what is possible and what not and you have to find the solutions in the world while not knowing what you are even supposed to do. These type of puzzle games always turned me off, since after a while i get stuck at some place and i dont have the slieghtest idea what i am supposed to do, if i should be even be here and so on. And then there are games like Portal, or The Talos Principle where you get thought very early the basic mechanic of the game and how it functions...but then the level you encounter are warping this easy concept more and more into a complex monster, where you really need all your brainpower to solve it. But even when the games can become really hard it always feels fair, since you know how the mechanics work, you just have to apply them to this new situation you are confrontet with. Relicta thanksfully fits into the 2nd kind of puzzlegame that i love so much. <br><br>Your main game mechanic is that you can charge a cube and certain fields positiv or negativ and thus make the Cube beeing pulled towards or pushed from certain object. Also you can remove the gravity from the cubes, so that if they have a certain acceleration into a direction, they can go towards it, until they hit a wall or source that pushes them into a different direction - and thats it! What sounds like a cool concept but that got figured out after a short while let me say you: No! Even after i played this game for 15 hours, the game still finds way to surprise me and force me to think of new ways how to use this mechanic to solve the later puzzles! Also i have to say: This game is hard! Especially in the later stages. But what i love about this kind of game that because you know of all the possible mechanics already early on, it is never unfair! There were points where i was to stubborn with a wrong idea how to solve a puzzle and was thinking "ohh man! This game is bugged! There is no solution" and called it a day...only to come back the next day, with a clear, fresh mind, and figured out a new method that worked this day! Moments like this really give me a great feeling of accomplishment and fun, and they make out  for all the frustration, when i am stuck on a certain puzzle longer then i would like :D <br><br>Also i have to congratulate the developers for how much polishment must have went through this game! Because since its a physics game in where your cubes can basicly fly everywhere, and since it is a not to big developer studio, i was afraid that there will be many moments where i have to load a savefile because my cube got stuck on impossible locations where you cant reach it anymore, making the solution of this puzzle impossible. And ohh boy did i ♥♥♥♥ up my cube-locations many times. But there was always a clever way how i could still get my cube, or how it could never get stuck on some place where you cant reach it anymore. In general the whole game was totally free from any kind of buggs, and i was really positive surprised how well polished everything plays. <br><br> My only critique with this game are the "Angle" puzzles. As you know by now, this game is physic based, but with this cool idea sadly come certain problems. Because the physic of how, where and with which tempo the cubes move is calculated by a physic engine, the outcome can sadly greatly vary. Most of the puzzles are very methodical. If you know what to do, you will accomplish the puzzle in 100% of the times. But there are also a few puzzles where your cube has to move in  a very certain angle to reach his goal without clear sides that will guaranteely push him in this direction...and in this cases you have to pray to RNG'sus that the cube will behave in the way you want to. Sometimes the cube will hit a wall, because you have misplaced your cube by one pixel to much to the left, sometimes you cube dont move at all even though it should, sometimes you make everything exactly as you should but the cube still hits a Wall to fast, and jumping to a location it never supposed to go. There were a few moments where i figured out exactly what to do, but still had to try 2-3 (in the later case even around 20 ( <span class="bb_spoiler"><span> Yes i look at you first puzzle of the last junglemap! </span></span> ) of doing the same thing over and over and hopeing that the physic "RNG" will be kinder to me this time around...what as you can imagine is extremly frustrating. But thankfully this kind of puzzles where really rare, and in most cases the difficulty only came from figuring out how to solve a puzzle and not by executing it right in terms of angles. <br><br><b> Story </b><br>Between solving puzzles your character talks with various characters that are also on the moonbase. This conversations are either pushing the plot forward (because you realise more and more that something is not right) or are just a welcome distraction in between puzzle levels where your character banters with the other Persons of the Station. And even though you sadly never really interact with them, it was so interesting to see how  much you come to care for all the characters from their voices alone! I really have to salute all the voiceactors in this game, i found all of them spot on! There was not a single character where i didnt really had an opinion on, i either really really loved them, or found them very shady and untrustworthy. I also dont know languages enough to hear which accent most of them are talking, but it was so refreshing to hear them talk since its not the generic english that you hear in most other games. I dont know how to describe it: While most of the games i rather thing of "wow this Voiceacting sounds really really bad" or "yep thats good voiceacting, where the characters sound as i think they would sound" i cant think of a nother game where i was looking forward so much of hearing the characters talk again...just to hear their voice, and cute banter once more.<br><br><b> Conclusion </b><br>All in all, i think that Relicta is a fantastic puzzle game, and a true hidden gem, that sadly dont seem to get the recognition it deserves. If you like the idea of puzzle games look no further, since this is without a doubt one of the best you will find. I wish the developers all the best and cant wait for their next projects, since they really got my attention after i saw how much work was put into every detail of this game.			</div>

																This is a good puzzle game for the price! Especially with the dlc out, there is plenty of puzzle to do. The major thing to note about this game is that it is more or less a free-form puzzle game. Unlike something like portal placing portals in set areas, you can place the cubes (the primary puzzle manipulation object in the game) wherever you want. One of the outcomes of this system is that it is not always obvious exactly what you need to do. There are some puzzle areas in the game I'm pretty sure I did incorrectly. Even if you are not looking to take shortcuts, or solve things incorrectly, the techniques the game teaches you to use look no different being used right or wrong. I myself think this is fine. There was never any time I could just skip the entire map, just got to the end in an alternative way. The only major problem is when the gameplay is set to be fast. In a game like portal, speed is a big part in many puzzles. In this game you wont be throwing cubes and catching and throwing objects. Just standing in front of a cube to pick it up can sometimes be a problem, a bit finicky. So, when the game wants some "fast" action it isn't very smooth. Luckily it seems the devs understand this limit. The game never goes past its limits, but you can feel it on some puzzle sections. A smaller problem is since you are placing the cubes anywhere, you need to align them carefully or you might shoot it off into nowhere. IT IS possible to soft lock the current puzzle you are on. It only happened to me once, but its just one of the consequence of having a very open puzzle system.<br><br>One other thing I want to mention. THE STORY, It has to be said. The story is insane, in the insane way. The voice acting is great, but the characters are also insane. Every time the story shows itself, I am being blasted with so much dramatics. The story is very consistent though, but it's like a soap opera turned up to 11, both in style and in volume. So much yelling.			</div>

																I played this game for the setting. I like sci-fi. This game definitely delivers on this front. The puzzles are good. They are not too difficult even for an inexperienced player. The graphics are good enough. The world is a bit less interactive than I expected. But it is tolerable. In general, it is a good game.			</div>

																If you like challenging puzzle games, give Relicta a try. It will wrinkle your brain.<br>BUT<br>If you like to relax while playing puzzle games, skip Relicta. It's too complex to be relaxing.<br><br>I'm in the second category. I made it through the Tower level, then - blocked. The difficulty escalated quickly after that point. I don't know if I'm dumb or my brain just isn't wired right to complete magnet-and-gravity puzzles, but it was impossible for me to progress past the Tower without major help from guides &amp; walkthroughs. That's not how I like to play puzzle games, so after 11 hours, quitting for now. Up to that point I enjoyed it - good graphics, good soundtrack, a surprisingly interesting story, and the puzzles were fun too. <br><br>But those advanced puzzles... Some problems that made the puzzles frustrating:<br>- frequently can't see where to go - ie the objective of the puzzle. <br>- it's not always clear what a switch or pressure pad does.<br><br>6/10 because I liked it right up to the part where it got too complicated.<br><br>Linux users: played perfectly using Proton 7.0-5 #Arch #Radeon			</div>

																Finished another 1st person view puzzle from my backlog... Wee!<br><br>Rather than saying this is yet another portal spawn... this one looks more like "The Turing Test" wannabe... as my review on The Turing Test said before, the game is pretty weak for a Square Enix game... so i am not sure why someone will want to follow its footsteps anyway other than the brand power of Square Enix. Anyway, this game is very similar to The Turing Test in most of the way especially in stage design and story telling part.<br><br>The puzzles of this game is no where near hard, but this turned out to be a pretty hard game. So what's making this game hard? The total randomness of some of its physic is causing a lot of trouble in the puzzle solving, and sometimes we can even solve the puzzle outside the intended solution just because the box floated and slide into a flavorable position. Yes, the box slides and floats with a momentum that's not fit for puzzle building imo... so this game ended up having more than one solution on most puzzles and we can simply cheat our way using those sliding malfuction of the puzzle design. In short, this is not a perfect puzzle design at all, pretty much a fail. And due to the sliding and floating flaws, even when we are doing the intended solution, we will find the box doesn't land on the switches in alignment most of the time. So there's no 100% fool proof solution to any of the puzzle and yeah, some even require "luck".<br><br>The story, started out pretty great and dramatic, eventhough it gives out a heavy feel of The Turing Test, which is very very linear and no side tracking, they actually pulled it off in telling a story better than The Turing Test imo... but about half way down the story, things started to change, a lot of the story seemed forced on and not very logically placed, more like just adding a detour to the story so they can link it to the puzzle solving part of the game... and pretty rough in the edges joining up the story pieces making some part of the game story feels awkward and out of place. And even though one of the ending turns out pretty nice (with the other being a predictable bad end), we don't get to meet a single living soul in this game, eventhough the protagonist (an old lady that seemingly able to survive high jumps from the puzzles) is talking to several people throughout the whole game, we don't get to meet any of them <span class="bb_spoiler"><span>other than Laia's dead(?) body in a suit so we can't see what's "inside" anyway</span></span>, we don't even get to see how the protagonist looks like in 3D, only her "profile picture" during her phone calls. Probably the devs are too lazy to make any character models...<br><br>Well... If this game only have those problems and none else, then i wouldn't have given this review a thumbs down. But what makes things worst is, this game physic engine is actually effected by our graphic settings. When we are playing a game with physical puzzle that require us to control gravity, this type of set off simply is unacceptable. For example, we can jump onto the box easier putting the setting on High, but will have difficulty jumping on the box in Highest setting. The box sliding problem varies with the settings too, when setting the graphic to low, everything seems light weighted. Not only that, the higher the setting, the more difficult to grab the box up, which is super frustrating when the box slide off our grab everytime we try to grab it, and have to repeat a few times or have to grab and turn in slow motion to avoid the box sliding off our hands. That adds to the stress in playing this game. And to top that up, this game has a very weird save system, it doesn't really save at the mini check points, and often require us to replay the game from the beginning of each stage after a continue from last play. Yeah, another fail design imo, and this can adds to the frustration if the game loads before some frustrating puzzle that you've already cleared.<br><br>And lastly, the physic coding they use in the game is very outdated.. kinda like those clumsy physic in games 20 years ago... almost can't believe this is a game released in 2020 with that type of physic. Well yeah, technically, we are supposed to be on the "Moon", but with the "terraformed" view only and the gravity is like on earth? Well, might as well "pretend" we are on the Moon then, it doesn't matter much since all we see is "Earth" in the game. If you notice the clouds (atmosphere) and water body in the game, then you might just noticed the dev never really did any research prio to their design, they just use the word terraformed to justify everything. Then why the moon anyway? Might as well just said it's on Earth. Oh yeah right... the buggy physic setting, blame it on bad terraforming! Brilliant! (roll eyes)<br><br>The only stuffs I like about this game is probably the rather beautifully made Terrarium placed all around the place in the game. The graphic is pretty since it's on the Unreal Engine afterall. But that's just it. Other than the graphic, the game is just on the average level, maybe even slightly below average. Can't recommend getting this on its full price, maybe on a large discount then you won't feel so frustrated with those lousy physics they use in game. And don't expect any mind blowing puzzles either, these are pretty easy and not very challenging at all. Those contraption puzzle games for kids probably do a way better job than this game in physic and "fun" imo. So yeah, don't give a high expectation if you wish to give this game a try. The graphic may makes it looks like a great game, but in the end, the graphic is all you've got to enjoy, the rest isn't on par. Story ain't bad, but if it's the story you are after, then my advise is, just youtube a play through and save your money and frustration.<br><br>Oh, and a little add-on here, this game isn't suitable for for kids either due to it's packed full of the F-words.<br><br>And... Nauseating alert! This game is by default set to maximum blurring and light effects which can easily cause one to feel dizzy in less than a minute's game play. There are settings in the game that allow us to turn off the effects and blurring as well as camera blobbing and other lighting stuffs but bear in mind that will cost you to end up with a slightly different physic result due to the game's physic somehow rely on graphic settings.			</div>

																Die Story dieses etwa 15h (Hauptspiel) langen Puzzler ist interessant und hat mir gut gefallen, aber das Design der Rätsel und das mangelhafte Bug-Testing haben mir spätestens im 1. DLC "Aegir Gig" jeglichen Spaß vermiest.<br><br>Die Rätsel sind teils unnötig kompliziert verschachtelt, mit komplett unnötigen Elementen befüllt und haben immer mal wieder Stellen an denen es ohne Guide mehr als möglich ist aufgrund von nicht 100% ausgereiften Mechaniken einfach hängen zu bleiben, was zur Folge hat, dass man ein ganzes Rätsel wiederholen kann. <br>Die Schwierigkeit der Rätsel ist eigentlich nicht besonders hoch, wenn man mal wo hängt dann nur wegen den beschriebenen unnötig verschachtelten Arealen oder weil die Lösung einfach wieder mal erst beim 2. oder 3. Versuch klappt (trotz richtigen Lösungswegs).<br><br>Wem Puzzler gefallen, der findet sicher spaßigere Alternativen deren Mechaniken besser ausgereift sind.<br>Dieses Spiel ist nur was für die leidensfähigsten unter den Puzzlerfreunden wirklich einen Blick wert.			</div>

																If you liked The Talos Principle, Portal, or The Witness, this will be right up your alley.  Much like The Talos Principle, Relicta offers individual puzzles in different worlds that grow in complexity as you go.  The anti-gravity and magnetism mechanics, among other features, provide plenty of novel puzzles with interesting solutions.  <br><br>The game also looks great, and the physics feel real, too.  There is a little more plot here than is required, which I largely ignored, but it does add some flavor on top of the pure puzzles.<br><br>If you are into puzzle games like those mentions, you'll enjoy Relicta.			</div>

																A very strange puzzle game. Not for its puzzles, which are fairly rote magnetic block pushing whose occasional flashes of brilliance are marred by loose controls and inconsistent physics. The game is strange because it's half puzzle game and half walking simulator, and honestly I think it would be more fun without the puzzles. The writing is authentic and well-delivered, the worldbuilding is cliche but reasonable, and you grow to care about these characters and their interactions on this moon base. But to get more of the story, you have to go through yet another cavalcade of blocks and magnets.<br><br>Overall if you liked Portal and liked The Martian, and are down for a piece of media that's worse than either of them but is trying to be both, it's at least worth a shot.			</div>

																Чем-то схожа с Принципом Талоса. Управление немного отличается, чем вызывает трудности: можно просто перенести, а приходится швырять из угла в угол на авось. Многовато цветовых акцентов, иногда чрезменрая сложность - лишняя мишура. Мир тесноват.			</div>

																パズルの仕組みはMagrunnerと同じで、新鮮味はない。<br>グラフィックは今風でよい感じ。<br>パズルを解いたときの達成感があまりなかった。簡単だと感じたのか、何か自分の好みから外れたか、それ以外か、よくわからない。<br>好きな人は好きだろう。一人称視点パズルが好きな人には、いろいろ遊んでいる人ほど、オススメしづらくなる。<br>デモ版があるので、試してから、買うべきか検討するとよいかなと思います。			</div>

																Relicta is a super linear puzzle game. It's simply going from Point A to B, from puzzle to puzzle, the corridors are just fillers. There's absolutely nothing to interact with outside of the puzzles and there are invisible walls everywhere to prevent you from exploring anywhere outside. Soon it becomes a chore rather than being fun. The earlier half of the game genuinely had good puzzles, it made me think and plan, almost made me feel clever but the other half just increases the number of hoops you have to go through just to get the cubes at the right place. For me, it went from 'This new area looks fun' to 'Let's get this over with and move on.'<br><br>I honestly can't continue playing Relicta anymore. I'm halfway through it but now I'm tired. It's not that the puzzles are hard, but it's a just complete slog to drag around cubes and it started to feel way more tedious than it needs to. I just couldn't see the point of playing the game anymore because I felt I was "working" to get the damn puzzles right. Once you reach the Tropical islands, you'll understand what I'm talking about. <br><br>The Story and Puzzles are totally disconnected, the sci-fi plot is interesting honestly but it doesn't work with puzzles: Oh a giant alien ate me? Oh I'm getting hallucinations and hearing voices? The AI has gone sentient? My daughter might be in danger? All you can do about it is solving damn puzzles that's it. See where I'm getting at? <br><br>The only reason I'm leaving a positive review is because it's an indie game and yes I did have fun even though for the short while it lasted. I even smiled from the inside when I saw that the protagonist is Indian. The voice acting is good, even though the speaker is non-native, there is no bad stereotypical Indian accent like Hollywood portrays. Though the quality of dialogue really degrades and no. of F bombs drop more &amp; more and it felt really unnecessary. (I didn't care much but if it is something that bothers you) <br><br>Maybe I'll continue where I left someday, but for now, I almost feel like I am wasting my time behind it. If you like these type of problem solving puzzle games, the game provides huge amount of content for the price. The graphics are good as well thanks to unreal engine. Surely pick it in a sale if you are thinking about it!			</div>

																Relicta is an enjoyable puzzle platformer with some interesting mechanics and a fun story-line. The collectibles help to flesh out the world a bit, making it so you want to find them to learn that much more about this future world. The characters you interact with have unique personalities and desires, some of which are less obvious than others.			</div>

																This game is one of the few genuinely challenging puzzle games i have played in years. i was honestly expecting the game to be around the 6-8 hour mark but well, from what ive seen the game is gonna be a lot longer than that. the puzzle mechanics are super interesting, one thing i liked was how the game just tells you the basics and lets you figure the rest out. The graphics are next level! aswell as being really well optimised, the only time the game ever lags for me is during cutscenes and well, thats to be expected imo. the one thing i would ask of the devs is to add a fov slider as i find the game hard to play for extended periods with such a small one. it honestly wouldnt be hard with unreal engine but thats the only thing i would change! well done guys			</div>

																Relicta è un puzzle game interessante ma non perfetto, che riesce a fare buon uso della fisica e di veicolarla ♥♥♥ successo all’interno di meccaniche riuscite e divertenti. A degli enigmi elaborati e soddisfacenti si va poi a intrecciare una trama densa di mistero, in grado di dare un motivo d’essere al titolo anche sul piano narrativo. Peccato solo per la scarsa leggibilità di alcune situazioni di gioco e per la variabilità insite nelle meccaniche legate alla fisica che riduce la sensazione di padronanza e controllo del giocatore. Una nota di demerito va inoltre all’incredibile numero di muri invisibili presenti in Relicta, un vero e proprio orrore a 2020 inoltrato.<br><br><a class="bb_link" href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tomshw.it%2Fvideogioco%2Frelicta-recensione%2F" target="_blank" rel=" noopener">https://www.tomshw.it/videogioco/relicta-recensione/</a>			</div>

																HB站月包入手，游戏游戏性其实不高，就是来来回回搬箱子，控制重力解密，解密性其实也不高，比较简单。我觉得游戏的亮点就在于——画质画面很好，你可以在游玩时看看风景。风景画面是真的不错的。			</div>

																After finishing the game I must say that I am looking forward to some DLC or even a second part.<br><br><br>Relicta is a puzzle game in which physics-driven cubes play a very, very important role. It may remind you, especially at the beginning of games like Portal, but as the story progresses it becomes its own sub-genre.<br><br>The premise is easy: Opposites attract each other while equal poles repel each other. What starts out as a simple move of this cube from point A to B in a linear fashion ends up being a challenge for your brain. Move the cube A from point A to point B but in the middle of the way you have to press a button that opens doors, put another polarized cube to attract the one that is traveling and thus make it turn or even prepare a path of polarized plates that in its path open doors to a robot that overrides the polarization and that is your key to the next puzzle.<br><br>And although when we play this kind of games we want puzzles, puzzles and more puzzles we also find a minimally decent story. The game starts by introducing several characters but it doesn't go deep into any of them so that they end up being irrelevant. <br><span class="bb_spoiler"><span> Around 4 - 5 hours the plot of the game takes a turn and what seems to be a mature, adult and even somewhat dark character ends up being the door to ironic phrases and bad jokes that accompany you until the end of the game, unfortunately. </span></span><br><br><b> PROS </b><br><b> -------------------  </b><br>- Very varied and even difficult puzzles, with many different mechanics and dynamics.<br>- Visually it has AAA quality.<br>- Optimized and highly polished (no bugs)<br>- The game is immersive, you can go for hours and hours without realizing it.<br>- The story animates the journey between the different puzzles and maps<br>- The developers have greatly improved the game, listening to the feedback of the players, since the first demo.<br><br><br><b> ♥♥♥♥ </b><br><b> -------------------  </b><br>- The story could be tremendously improved.<br>- There are some mechanics that are introduced in the middle of the game that are not explained beforehand and can be frustrating			</div>

																This game is .... OK I guess. It looked good from the screenshots and it does look good in-game but that's 90% of the best thing about this game: how it looks. For the rest it's basically a very poor man's Portal but with annoying voice actors, a mediocre story and worse puzzles. <br><br>Despite the game's good graphics, the game lacks a soul - the environment is far too clean and lacks detail to make it a believable world. In Portal you had the excuse that they were test tracks - here you have squeaky clean corridors &amp; rooms with at most a cup of coffee here and there. OK, the game was made on a small budget but giving heart to your game to me is a very important element and it wouldn't take all that much effort to do. Just add some more personal notes, leave around personal effects, show the world has been lived in.<br><br>The game also uses the lamest excuse for you to do puzzles. Crew trapped and freezing in an arctic biome? "Well you have to do the puzzles to reach them". Yeaaah right. Because the only route anywhere is through  a giant maze of puzzles using gloves only you are wearing. What nonsense.<br><br>I have to give props to the devs for trying but a game is more than a "by the numbers" thing and I feel that it doesn't offer enough outside its basic scope. You have a "story" which is not all that interesting and it's clear the game comes up with excuses for you to do pretty lame box puzzles. Portal had a far better mechanic than this and also had GlaDOS to keep things interesting. This game only offers some annoying people with heavy Indian accents blabbing in your ear all the time.<br><br>It's a 5/10 basically - at this point I'd rather they'd have cut all the story nonsense and just given you a bunch of puzzles.			</div>

																Nice graphics. <br>But story is poor and puzzles become boring.<br>The density of puzzles is too high, after 20 minutes of the game you start to get tired.<br>Big job were done, but in my opinion it was better to split this game on several small ones and rich the gameplay with cutscenes and plot. <br><br>it's 6/10<br><br>I gave up in the middle of the game and watched the rest walkthrough on youtube<br><br>P.S. I played Portal, The Stanley Parable, The Turing Test, Superliminal, The light matter, etc. <br>They all are cool because plot events and puzzles are balanced there. Unfortunately, this is not the case of this game.			</div>

																Hidden gem of puzzle games. I really enjoyed beating it. The difficulty was balanced just right for me - not boringly easy when you can read the solution as soon as you enter the puzzle room, but not tediously hard so you could get really stuck. A few puzzles can be cheesed or at least feel like you solved them in an unintentional way. But this was actually also satisfying, because it felt more like you outsmarted the game, instead of it being just broken. The story is ok and the characters are likable. Great game, it deserves more attention.			</div>

																With 2 free DLC's and tons of challenging puzzles it is in my opinion one of the best physics based puzzle game in the Portal/Cube genre. It is a bit repetitive but will keep you busy for a long time. Lots of thanks to the developers, muchas gracias			</div>

																A bit more fleshed out lore than Portal, and a bit more puzzle difficulty as well.<br><br>The game is decent, with a few minor hiccups here and there. <br>IE. <br>-Some puzzles requires pixel perfect placement<br>-Some puzzles does not have enough checkpoints or method / ways to undo a mistake.<br><br>Game time: About 7~10 hours of puzzle solving + 2 expansions.<br><br>Relicta is a generally decent first person puzzle platform game. Basically Portal, but with Magnets and Gravity.			</div>

																You are a lunar scientist with some magic gloves that let you control gravity and magnetic polarity of magic cubes. You can ride the cubes and make interesting trick shots.<br>This game is the other side of the coin of Portal games. Nice puzzles and definitely deserves a playthrough.<br><br>It also works on Linux through Proton-GE			</div>

																It's a 3D puzzle-platformer, one of the billion or so that follows in the wake of Portal's re-invention of the genre. As the genre goes though, some of these puzzles are nicely challenging, and the story is sufficiently interesting to motivate the solving of more puzzles.			</div>

																So the moon is in the future occupied by Asians with bad attitude and constantly swearing. They all sound the same, angry and peessed off. Makes it obvious one person wrote it all - no-body in this game feels different than the other. The game itself is sticking boxes on pressure plates to get through doors? They want £16.00 for this? Thankfully I got it from Humble Bundle ages ago. I wouldn't pay 50p for this. Yawn freaking yawn. Now to uninstall it.			</div>

																-Some puzzles were extremely tedious if you messed up even in the slightest. The difficulty never really ramps up, the puzzles just get longer with more and more opportunities to mess something up<br>-Waiting for the drones to move around was painful.<br>-Why is there a speed running achievement? I don't see how you could think it's a good idea to have that achievement in the game <br>-Collisions are very bizarre, boxes getting stuck midair, yourself getting stuck midair, etc.<br><br>it's painful looking at my stats and being one off of 100% for this game, but there's no way I'm playing through the game again. The overall story is good, but the dialogue is jam packed with vulgar language that really ruined it for me.<br><br>I'd give this game a 5.5 I guess, I really liked the art style, but almost everything else is sub-par			</div>

																Very well made physics puzzle game with a lot of levels for the price - took around 40 hours to beat the whole game altogether.  Each new puzzle presents it's own challenges and there are sometimes multiple ways to solve the same puzzle if you look closely enough.  My only slight complaint is that the solutions to the puzzles feel cheap sometimes - like carrying a box sideways up a stair way that has purple box-blocking barriers, and then moving the mouse around until the box is in just the right position to be placed over the railing at the top.  My advice - not all solutions are elegant.  If you're stuck, try something that might seem stupid.  This is probably only about 5-10% of the puzzles in the game.<br><br>The story was decent and kind of funny at times.			</div>

																I like puzzles but this first-person story is boring. I'd rather skip any lore or cutscenes. Just take me to the puzzles. Okay, I didn't think this was going to be puzzle game at all. I just like the nice scenery but I think that's what the game is trying to do. It shows nice scenery but only allows you to enjoy if you beat the puzzles. This game also reminds me of another first-person puzzle game that is much better than this game. I wouldn't waste your money on this game unless you love puzzles. If you like first-person puzzle games, then get this game while its on sale.			</div>

																игра на пару вечеров, большинство головоломок слишком линейны, нет как таковой свободы действий, всегда, найдя точку, с чего начать, пазл в вашей голове сложится за пару минут, а дальше только ловкость рук как быстро вы это пройдете, любителям головоломок может понравится, учитывая как мало неплохих игр в этом жанре выходит.			</div>

																Wie viele vor mir schon warnten: Knüppelschwere Rätsel etwa ab Spielmitte, mit völlig neuen Mechaniken und zahllosen Tricks, die man anwenden MUSS, um weiter zu kommen. Rätsel so komplex verschachtelt, dass man prinzipell eine Weile braucht, bis dass man weiß, was das Level von einem will.<br>Eine unsympatische Protagonistin, die viiiiiel zu oft unnötig Vulgärbegriffe benutzt, ohne das es witzig oder sinnvoll ist. Eine lahme Erklärung, warum man diese Rätsel durchlaufen muss. Wird spätestens absurd, wenn es gegen Ende storytechnisch um Zeit geht. <br>Träger Plottwist, aber sympatischer "Freund". <br>Schöne Gegend, viele unsichtbare Wände, leere Einrichtungen.<br>Musste etwa 12 Level vor Ende völlig entnervt einen Guide raussuchen, weil ich einen Trick nicht angewandt habe. Danach war die Luft irgendwie total raus und ich habe öfters in den Guide geschaut, als es selbst probiert. Ich weiß nicht, warum ich mich damit rumgequält habe. Verschwendete 17h meines Lebens.<br><br>Fazit: Nur für euch, wenn ihr Magneten liebt und/oder Spiele wie The Talos Prinziple zu einfach fandet.<br>			</div>

																 Un juegazo que te hace devanarte los sesos para resolver puzzles muy bien diseñados (¡alerta! posible dolor cerebral en niveles avanzados) y en unos entornos ♥♥♥ visuales impactantes. La mecánica básica basada en físicas (magnetismo y gravedad) es simple y elegante pero da pie a un sinfín de posibilidades. Además, la historia (que aun no se me ha revelado al completo) tiene un aura de misterio muy interesante y parece muy bien ambientada. Si eres un aficionado a la ciencia ficcion o los puzzles 3d, este es tu juego.<br><br>----<br>Great puzzle game that forces you to use your brain (it can hurt in later levels) sorounded with stunning visuals and landscapes. The basical mechanics based on physics (magnetism and gravity) are simple yet they offer countless posibilities. Furthermore, the lore (not yet fully uncovered) surround the puzzle solving with a well ambiented mystery aura. Must try for sci-fy and 3D puzzle lovers.			</div>

																As others have noted the story and dialogue is grating but you can skip that. What is inexcusible, however, is that at one point I reached a puzzle and I had no idea what was expected of me because part of the puzzle was obscured from my vision. That's just bad design.			</div>

																Relicta will always be compared to games like Portal and The Talos Principle and out of those three it comes a strong third. The short version of this review is that yes, it's a good game, yes, you should give it a go if you like first person physics puzzlers, no it's not the best of its kind, and no it's not going to be your favourite.<br><br>PUZZLES<br>The puzzles themselves are clever though it's worth saying that they aren't super taxing. I had to get a fair bit of help with later levels in Portal and Talos Principle whereas with Relicta I didn't have to check all that often and usually I was stuck because I'd not seen something, rather than I didn't get the solution. That'll be a pro or ♥♥♥ depending on how much of a challenge you want.<br><br>The magnetism and zero-gravity mechanics are solid and the puzzles well put together - levels are well designed so that most sections can be re-attempted without a length reset if you mess up - only in some parts of the Ice Queen update did I find some of the harder puzzles had really tedious resets if you missed something.<br><br>The weakest part is that by half way through the base game you've been taught all the different tricks. The rest of the game is is still solid but you've had all of your "oh that's cool" moments. Ice Queen adds some new mechanics which were good fun though.<br><br>The other downside is that some of the puzzle rooms got quite big and there's no mid-puzzle saving. The levels in the Aegir Gig update even warn you about this - those ones are pretty fun levels though.<br><br>The visuals are very good for a game of this nature, and they developers put extra work in for the two free expansions (Aegir Gig and Ice Queen) that they could easily have avoided, just reusing old assets.<br><br>The story is pretty average average, lacking the punch of Portal or the background intrigue of Talos Principle. I think the voice acting would have been helped if the script had less swearing in it - the bad language didn't add anything to the drama and the actors had to pour a lot of energy into the swearing which undermined their other efforts.			</div>

																Truly beautiful visuals. Especially impressive how good it looks without that RTX nonsense.<br>Challenging and demanding puzzles.<br>Sometimes indecent, vulgar language.<br>Annoying, childish dialogues and moody, noisy, not likable characters. Although I liked the idea of having some plot in a puzzle game but that was poorly written.			</div>

																As a copy of Portal and the Talos Principle, this falls short. the plot is not original and the gameplay is repetitive. Not to mention that the puzzles are boring and the graphics tend to be generic.<br><br>I don't recommend this one unless you received it for free. Otherwise save a little and buy the originals. Portal 1 and 2, The Talos Principle, among similar ones that are far better than this one.			</div>

												For a game that boasts about how beautiful its environment is, it sure works its hardest to make sure you explore hardly any of it with invisible walls at every corner.<br>Extremely restrictive movement (no crouch or even jumping in certain sections) makes completing puzzles you already know the solution to a challenge, and not much in the way of innovating to solve a puzzle in an unintended way (because of all the invisible walls).<br>The attempt to put a story was ok but felt weak, am i really supposed to believe people use language that is outdated today over 100 years in the future?<br><br>I wanted to like this game but solving the puzzles wasn't as fun as it is in other 3d puzzle games like Talos Principle etc. <br>If you are desperate for a new 3d puzzle game buy it on sale but I would skip it at full price			</div>

																Portal done wrong, just replace portals with magnetism and gravity.<br>The story is dragged out and boring. Luckily it can be skipped.<br>There's a gazillion of pointless animations you have to wait out - PDA opening. Sliding cards into PDA. Touching to open the doors. Especially lovely when you have no idea where to go and so pointlessly wait to open doors you've already opened twice.<br>There's no reason why a game of this concept should require a significant amount of computing power to not be laggy. But for whatever reason the authors decided it'd be a good idea to spam the game with foliage and stuff. <br>The hands just flailing around in the air are kinda pointless too, especially since you can't see the rest of your body when you look down.<br>All controls are made for two handed play - one hand on the keyboard, one on the mouse. So why in the world did they put the PDA key to I and not TAB?<br><br>Essentially the only good element in this game is the puzzle element. With that the authors did a good job and since it's the main aim of the game, I am willing to recommend it for that. But the game as a whole is unimpressive, with rather mediocre design.			</div>

																A very difficult and challenging puzzle game. While playing through it constantly reminded me of the game play mechanics of Portal. It has a well developed story and theme that the puzzles only build on.			</div>

																게임 자체는 포탈과 같이 2가지의 기술을 통해 퍼즐을 풀어나가는 것이다 <br>포탈은 직접적으로 주황과 청색의 포탈로 물건을 싦어 나르며 퍼즐을 풀었지만 <br>이게임은 주로 상자를 조작 하나 , 상자의 속성을 양/음 극으로 바꾸어 자석처럼 붙었다 떨어지는 기능을 사용할수있다.<br><br>문제는 해당게임은 퍼즐이긴하지만, 네비게이션이 일체없으며 , 플레이어가 몇십분 헤매고 있으면 힌트라도 나와야 하는데 <br>그것도 안나와서 공략을 보지않고선 진행이 안될정도로 매우 불편하다 <br>			</div>

																Any experienced gamer will romp through this, the puzzles themselves are not difficult. In the same way Portal was just a 3D rendering of a classic puzzle game, so is this, the logic behind the puzzles is basic with a graphical wrapper. While that sounds harsh, it's no different to tons of other puzzle games out there.<br><br>I mentioned Portal, this is nothing like Portal in the sense that the storyline is just cancer. If you can manage to listen to more than 3 lines of truly awful dialogue and take note of the overly sentimental nonsense storyline then well done you, I certainly never managed it.<br><br>Is it a bad game? No, it's certainly not a bad game. Has there been considerable time and effort put into the title? Sure, you can see that. Is it "good"... em... well that really depends on your experience, imo. If you are new to puzzle games then this is as good as any other to get (if you can deal with the dialogue) but anyone who has played similar puzzle games will find that once you scratch the surface of this game all you find is more surface.<br><br>It's a 'no' from me, if only because Steam doesn't have a 'meh' option.			</div>

																Resoundingly "meh."  I hope it picks up in pace, but noting the game mechanics, I doubt it will.  The dialogue is soooo cringey, the characters are boring, but they nailed it with the visuals.  Level design, ehhh... I mean sort'a.  Like, why are there so many helmets just kind'a laying around everywhere?  And random beakers of fluids just sitting out.  I get it, "Girl-power science station, GO!," but like....c'mon.<br><br>It really isn't terrible, but it's DEFINITELY not worth your $20 in 2021.  That's almost a full gallon of gasoline! &gt;_&gt;			</div>

																Love this game so far! Great graphics and storyline! Voice acting on point. The puzzles are interesting and not over the top.  From what I gather, you are a scientist experimenting with technology discovered by a shady lab that dissapeared, technology decades past what it should be. Sounds like a good idea, right? Things seem to go well for two or three years. But at the start of the game you find out something went wrong! Now, you will find out what happened. The main character is an indian woman with a daughter which was a nice change from the usual caucasian male. I love her spunky attitude and rebellious nature. She also comes off as responsible and wanting to make the world a genuine better place, not a crazy scientist who will explore new tech even if it destroys all humankind. I never realized how often the crazy mad scientist sterotype came up before this. The nature graphics and lab were really cool to see too. My favorite are the little flying robots.  Despite my short time playing the game so far, I am confident I will keep playing. Check it out!			</div>

																The puzzles are challenging, require forethought and are a decent mix of both active execution (ie requires timing / precision) and simple tactical / planning puzzles. What ruins it for me is the wholly selfish, unprofessional MC. She's presumably a scientist, working in a lunar station, cooperating with other teams in a delicate work environment and she's just a b!tch to EVERYONE all the time, like, why? It's suffering to play as her because you want to fail everything in the hopes that there's an easter egg good ending where the station explodes, and your collective genes are promptly removed from the pool, to the betterment of all. <br><br>Also it's pretty unoptimized and drops frames a lot on DX12 (only 1080p), but DX11 was okay.<br>Ultimately a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, desi-flavoured version of Talos Principle or any of the other Portal-likes, that brings little new to the table, and barely maintains status quo whilst managing to be horribly insufferable. Playing the game muted improved the experience, but not enough to recommend it.			</div>

																It's an alright puzzle game. I would give it a 5-6/10. It's not bad, but I can't recommend it. There are better puzzle games out there. There is a huge problem with the game though. There aren't enough white people and there aren't enough men. I have been told by games urinalists that race and gender are the most important thing. As a straight white male I find it really offensive that this game doesn't represent me!			</div>

																Wenn ein ehemaliger Mitarbeiter eines Scammer-Callcenters zu viel Rosamunde Pilcher und South Park gesehen hat, sowie dann damit beauftragt wird, Dialoge zu schreiben, während sein 8-jähriger kleiner Bruder versucht, diese vermeintlich "logistischen" als auch "dramatischen" Aussagen umzuformulieren, dürfte das Ergebnis so ziemlich genau diese Dialoge sein!<br><br>Gefühlte 40% "♥♥♥♥", 30% "You" sowie 20% sinnfreies Gejammer und Beschimpfungen, garniert mit 10% Storytelling. Die Sprecherstimmen sind so abgrundtief lächerlich, dass man es schon als peinliche Belustigung bezeichnen kann.<br><br>Pro:<br>        Schöner Aufbau<br>        Stimmige Farbgebung<br>        Logische Elemente<br><br>Contra:<br>        Physikalische Effekte sind teilweise etwas merkwürdig<br>        Es gibt gelegentlich kleine Objekt-Bugs oder das Festkleben der Spielfigur<br>        Die Story ist sehr schwach und stört sogar in dieser Form etwas<br><br>Fazit:<br>Man muss bei diesem Spiel etwas knobeln, die Schwierigkeit liegt hier bei etwa 50%. Das Ausprobieren von verschiedenen Herangehensweisen bringt zumindest mir eine enorme Spielfreude. Die Steuerung und Geschicklichkeitsanforderungen liegen hier jedoch zumindest für mich über dem Durchschnitt – bis hin zur Nervigkeit.<br><br>Würde ich dieses Spiel empfehlen? Wenn ja, für welchen Spieler-Typ?<br>Ich habe das Spiel für nur 1,99 € in der BF-Aktion gekauft, es ist aber definitiv mehr wert.<br><br>!!! Unter 10 € kaufen !!!			</div>

																TL;DR: Decent puzzler. Wait for a sale.<br><br>If you like first person puzzlers, there is a good chance you'll enjoy this somewhat.<br><br>The game feels little uneven. What I mean is some puzzles are great. Sometimes the puzzles are difficult and it takes me a while to figure out the solution and when I have the “aha” moment, it feels great and then I can solve the puzzle. But then there are the puzzles where I immediately see the intended solution right away, but is tedious and annoying to execute, requiring way too many retries just to execute the solution that I already understand but can’t quite get the timing of. I hate those puzzles.<br><br>And then there are the puzzles that I have the aha moment and can see how it *should* work, but I can’t convince the floating cube to go to the precise direction that I needed to and it either gets stuck or falls into a place where I can’t reach it and I have to start the long puzzle over again from the beginning just to retry the part that doesn’t work consistently, and I just get frustrated. So then I look up the solution on YouTube to make sure that I am doing it right, and the person that provided “a” solution was also frustrated, but found a more advanced yet  *easier* way to bypass half the puzzle, so I never actually learned if I was doing it right. 🤣<br><br>The PDA button is so easy to accidentally press on a gamepad, and takes so long to go through the animation before you can dismiss it. Thankfully, you can remap (or remove) the button that triggers the PDA.<br><br>I didn't care for the music. What I mean is that music does a lot to create the atmosphere, and I felt like I didn't connect with the atmosphere, and when I thought more about it, I realized it was the music. It was too quiet, and is lacking something. It helped to turn up the music volume, and turn down all the other volumes.<br><br>One of my biggest gripes is the inability to save in the middle of a puzzle, and no chapter select to easily replay specific levels.<br><br>One thing I really appreciated was the inclusion of a "run" button, so I can move around faster.<br><br>Some of the puzzles seem to have parts that have no reliable solution, and are based on luck.<br><br>In a couple cases, I'm not even sure how I'm "supposed" to solve the puzzle, and when I found a solution, it feels like I broke the puzzle or solved it in an unintended way. I like that I was able to progress to the next level, but when I solve something because a box floats and bounces around randomly, and coincidentally *accidentally* ends up where I need it to go, that doesn’t feel right and it's not a satisfying solution.<br><br>I didn’t like the writing. The voice acting is OK, I mean, there were some parts I didn't like, but the acting was not terrible. It irritates me when one character supposedly interrupts another character, so they stop talking mid sentence, but there is a pause/silence before the next line is played. But that's not really the fault of the voice actors. The story was OK. I didn't find the story terribly compelling. It was merely there to string together the puzzles to provide a reason for doing them. I stopped caring about the characters and just wanted to get through all the puzzles. I really liked the last set of puzzles.<br><br>Overall, it was still an enjoyable game to play because I purchased it at a good sale price ($3), but does not compare to my favorite first person puzzlers: Portal, The Talos Principle, and The Entropy Centre.<br><br>I will never get the speed run achievement because it would be too frustrating for me to redo all the puzzles with a time limit.<br><br>I do wish there was a level select, or at least chapter select, or a way to replay specific puzzles, since there were some puzzles that I really liked, and some of the more frustrating ones could be considerably less frustrating if I could retry them… easily.			</div>

																It just bored me, is so long and empty. Why make it so big if there will be nothing to fill it with? Its almost a walking simulator.<br><br>I really like this kind of game, and even if I don't like one so much, I still try to finish it. This one, I just stopped playing it for a while, and right now, I decided to uninstall and forget it. I can't recommend it.			</div>

																Relicta is a mixed bag for me. Belongs squarely to same genre of games as Portal 1&amp;2 and The Talos Principle (TTP), it isn't nearly as good as those.<br><br>The good:<br>- looks very nice, especially the jungle levels; some levels are really laid out in three dimensions<br>- some "new" physics compared to the classics mentioned above: anti-gravity and magnetism<br>- a good amount of play time<br>- you probably never have to reset a puzzle because you're really stuck<br>- keept me playing while waiting for TTP 2<br><br>The bad:<br>- the puzzles in the second half of the game just keep getting longer/bigger, way too long really, without really feeling more interesting or even harder<br>- the constant verbal abuse in the first half of the game was really annoying to me<br>- the story isn't bad, but really thin and formulaic<br>- various usability issues: the game tries to make a number of actions easy (like grabbing or dropping a cube), but often fails to do so (gets your intent wrong and pulls you away), and this is mildly irritating<br>- the hall areas are a real waste of time, even though they look okay<br>- the areas LOOK open for exploration, and yet they are clearly not<br><br>Overall, I don't think it's worth the full price, and not worth playing to the end (except for the sets). I think I'll skip the two DLCs, even though they were included.<br><br>Recommended with caveats, only if you're a real fan of the genre, and in need of more 3D puzzles, whatever they are.<br>			</div>

																Some believe that puzzle games should be all about brain and not require dexterity or luck. I leave it up to you to decide for yourself. But in Relicta, you will need a little dexterity and a little luck. Sometimes you will struggle with one or the other and might be frustrated because 1) you know what needs to be done but you can't quite do it or 2) there is a subtly new way of interacting with the universe that you did not yet realize and the game did not do a good enough job of teaching you. I don't mean a new mechanism, but a known mechanism that you need to manage a little differently. You'll know what I mean when you encounter it. <br><br>So listen, this game is not perfect, but there is delight along the way, there is satisfaction, and there is a LOT of content. A lot. An outlier in that respect. The puzzles are not easy. The setting is visually interesting and not just an afterthought as is too often the case with puzzle games. I wasn't too into the story aspect but there is that for those who like it (and the rest can skip it). Also, you should know there is abundant swearing. Despite its flaws, I am fond of this game and it is without doubt excellent value for the money. I will look forward to this studio's other games.			</div>

																Interesting (and challenging) physical puzzle games. The dialogues of the background story are performed vividly. Very good stability (no crash at all after more than 70 hours). The surrounding scenery gives a nice atmosphere. One negative aspect: some puzzles (at the end of the story) are quite big, and there is no save operation offered by the game. But after all a great puzzle game.			</div>

A rewind button would be nice there.<br><br>Cringe story &amp; voice acting, as is usual these days, but thank Almighty Polygon for a SKIP Dialog button!			</div>

																♥♥♥ mucho dolor pero me decepcionó. Los escenarios son muy bonitos, pero el diseño de niveles pudo ser mejor. Las cámaras comienzan pequeñas (tamaño justo) pero luego te abruman por lo grandes que son que a veces no te queda muy claro por donde comenzar a resolverlas. También puede ser porque estaba acostumbrado a Portal y Talos Principle, pero no me gusta recorrer toda la sala apretando botones y viendo qué puertas activan/desactivan para después regresar y empezar. <br><br>Hay veces en que comienzas el puzzle por inercia y colocas el botón donde crees que va pero no sabes qué se activó, así que toca seguir el cable hasta descubrirlo. Hay ocasiones en que nunca utilicé algunos mecanismos/interruptores así que no supe si resolví las cámaras como se suponía. Te puedes quedar atrapado algunas veces así que toca reiniciar el nivel.<br><br>Por último, citando a Eric de LyV: Tomas un cubo, pulsas un botón, abres una puerta, vas por un segundo cubo, abres una segunda puerta, vuelves por el primer cubo, pulsas otro botón para abrir una tercera puerta, juntas ambos cubos para una cuarta puerta... Es lo que vas a hacer como un 80% de todas las pruebas. Y no, tener las pruebas en diferentes biomas no significa variedad en la jugabilidad, sólo en lo visual. <br><br>Si no te molesta nada de esto, aún así podrías darle una oportunidad estando en descuento. <br>5/10			</div>

																Relicta is a physics puzzler, in the vein of Portal and similar games. It does a good job providing interesting challenges, and it introduces new mechanics at a good pace. The story is a bit take-it-or-leave-it, but the physics puzzles are really what you're here for anyway.			</div>

																传送门之后我已经有半年多没玩过这么好的游戏了。真是太幸运了我能遇到。非常感谢作者！！！这游戏28个小时才通关帕特尔（女主）视角章节。共三章男主/女主/冰后视角。和传送门玩法一致。可以看到通关人数不多。关卡多到丧心病狂。过关后非常愉悦的说一句就这？玩多了也会骂作者一句畜生。但也有飞地形。直接过关的作者通道。我个人是非常喜欢的。你买这个游戏你最少能玩50个小时。			</div>

																Im Großen und Ganzem ein recht gutes Puzzle-Game. Die Puzzles sind oftmals um einiges anspruchsvoller im Vergleich zu Spielen wie Portal und dementsprechend auch, umso interessanter für Fans dieses Genre.<br>Trotz weniger Mechanics (die 3 Grund-Fähigkeiten (Farbe blau, Farbe rot, Block schweben lassen) und später Roboter und Plattformen die die Blöcke transportieren), kann das Spiel doch recht kompliziert, gerade eben die Bereiche die unendlich groß.<br><br>Hinsichtlich dessen gibt es ein paar Kritikpunkte:<br>-&gt; Der Größte; die Spieldauer. Das Spiel ist super wenn man regelmäßig mal 30-120 min. daran spielt, aber 5-6 Stunden (zum Beispiel im Stream) sind sehr anstrengend. Deswegen empfehle ich jeden die Spieldauer pro Session zu beschränken. An sich ist die lange Spieldauer auch nicht so ein negativer Punkt, da man hierfür viel Content für sein Geld kriegt.<br>-&gt; Die großen offenen Bereiche sind oftmals durch ihre Größe unübersichtlich und entmutigend dadurch. Man verliert schnell den Überblick über sämtliche Puzzles und somit muss man gezielt sich einen Pfad vorher festlegen oder mit dem Block quer durch das Level schweben (ja, man kann das Spiel exploiten und ganze Bereiche skippen).<br>-&gt; Story ist belanglos und zu langsam. Sie wird "plötzlich" erst gegen 60% des Spiels aufgegriffen und verläuft richtig linear von dort an. An sich gab es im nachhinein schon ein paar lustige bzw. auch interessant Dialoge (dadurch das sich eine Prämisse gebildet hat), aber im Endeffekt zu spät und nur isolierten Instanzen.#<br><br>Viele Spieler werden die Story wahrscheinlich nie mitbekommen haben.<br>Schlussendlich würde ich das Spiel jedem empfehlen der das Genre mag und sich bei dem Schwachpunkten zu helfen weiß (was generell Schwachpunkte im dem Genre sind).<br>Einen Daumen hoch.			</div>

																Si te gustan los puzzles, un buen desafío difícil y además tenga un buen argumento, este es tu juego. Las mecánicas que tiene son de gravedad y física, aparte se puede decir que tiene un buen estilo visual.<br>En cuanto a DLC vale la pena el ice queen ya que amplia la historia principal y añade nuevas mecánicas a los puzzles. <br>Para mi de los mejores juegos de puzzle que he jugado por no decir el mejor.			</div>

																As a puzzle game about gravity, it pushed me away initially, but then pulled me in hard.<br>I found it very relaxing. No music, just background sounds, no enemies, no time running out, just you and the puzzle to solve. It gives you possibilities to solve puzzles in non-designed way sometimes as you learn using your powers.			</div>

																Dobra gra w stylu portal z zaskakująco dobrą fabułą gdzie momentami można się uśmiać.<br>Gra ma parę niejasnych mechanik których nie przedstawia graczowi bezpośrednio trzeba do nich dojść samemu. mimo tego jest warta przejścia dla osoby lubiącej gry logiczne.			</div>

																Definitely recommend this game even with it's faults.<br>Puzzles are good, not insanely difficult but enough to exercise the noodle. <br>The bad...story is unnecessary and the running around the huge base is ridiculous. Just gimme puzzles, forget the rest.			</div>

																some "solutions" are so obscure, they ruin the puzzles for me. the physics sometimes makes no sense at all (same setup, different outcomes) and the game gives you absolutely zero feedback when you need it the most. especially for a game like this, the rules need to be absolutely clear, otherwise the player spends his time making random guesses because it's unclear whether something is supposed to work or not. you need to be able to solve these things in your head. it shouldn't be necessary to repeat the same thing many times to see if it's possible in game. if you had the correct idea, the game needs to show you that. if your idea is wrong, it must *clearly* not work. <br>but in relicta, things often barely work (or don't), so the player is often lost in an ocean of maybes.<br>not a single time i looked up a solution did i think "oh, I was so stupid". it was always "wait, *that* was an option?". the game simply fails to present the rules and sometimes hides relevant puzzle elements or how they are supposed to be used. sometimes  the rules change without any notification, like when you're suddenly required to micromanage a floating cube (until thast point you always only had to set things up correctly in advance)			</div>

																Buena colección de puzles que le sacan partido a conceptos tan sencillos como atraer, repeler y levitar; todos están bien planteados para que se entienda que solución se busca aunque pueden surgir picos de dificultad cuando se espera que pienses al margen de lo que se te ha enseñado hasta ahora. En ocasiones para avanzar habrá que experimentar para comprobar si algo se puede hacer o no y al no haber ningún sistema de pistas puede parecer más rebuscado de la cuenta.<br><br>También tiene una historia que ayuda a hilar el avance ♥♥♥ un universo interesante por conocer. La trama central tarda en arrancar pero una vez lo hace lo único que chirría es que sólo se pueda viajar entre zonas importantes de la base completando desafíos.<br><br>Los gráficos se ven de forma espectacular incluso en un PC no demasiado potente. Han conseguido un muy buen grado de fotorrealismo y cuenta ♥♥♥ arquitecturas y biomas variados para no aburrir.<br><br>Por si fuera poco, los desarrolladores han incluido dos campañas extra de forma gratuita ♥♥♥ puzles de mayor complejidad que exprimen las mecánicas.			</div>

																Game would have been fun only if it wasnt required to do the same manoeuver for over half an hour bcs physic is broken and you better get lucky boxes hits at the perfect angle at the right time...<br>The environment is pretty and wide wich feels nice but its also very empty !!<br><br>I enjoy the mecanics very much, and i love challenges but "bad" level design and moody floating cube physics totally ruined the experience for me :(			</div>

																As of now, I haven't finished Relicta, but I feel like I have a good grasp on what it is about. Hell, I think I've already seen pretty much everything the game has to offer. <br><br>Let's start with the positives: graphics are truly gorgeous - beautiful landscapes, detailed environments with vibrant colors and artistic lighting. Levels create a calming mood further enhanced by nice atmospheric music. It's a shame that you can't really explore the world you traverse. Futuristic technology present throughout the game has a distinctive look (the cube design is especially cool), although a bit generic. Nevertheless, it contrasts really well with naturalistic biomes you encounter. I don't care about the story, didn't watch a single cutscene, so I have no opinion on it. The overall premise of manipulating magnetic fields and gravity is also cool and pretty unique - I love the inclusion of cube-riding, very satisfying way of moving around. I would say puzzle design is solid and creative at times, when they force you to think outside of the box, but..<br><br>BUT<br><br>... Relicta becomes very repetitive very quickly. You use the same mechanics over and over again ad nauseam, puzzles feel too similar to each other, barely introducing any new mechanics whatsoever. From what I've seen on YouTube, final levels aren't very different from the ones in the beginning. As the game progresses, puzzles become needlessly large, even maze-like, but more often than not you know exactly what to do after like 20 sec of exploring, but still need to run around doing tedious chores for about 5 mins before you're able to progress. Wonky physics and janky hitboxes are your bread and butter. Not to mention, at times all I can see is a visual cluster♥♥♥♥ of colorful magnetic fields, cubes and laser fields. And don't get me started on the hub area, it's totally pointless and legit annoying after a couple of hours.<br><br>Overall, not a bad game, but don't expect anything amazing. It's just a mediocre experience. Another Portal wannabe.<br><br>			</div>

																This was a good puzzle game, very much like "Q.U.B.E." but with beautiful (and less oppressive) environments.<br><br>The puzzle aspects are almost all based on manipulation of gravity and magnetism. The physics (at least for me) worked well and were very intuitive (remember that magnetism can go through surfaces!), and only a few times I had to fudge around my solution to get it to work in ways which seemed unintended.... oh, probably my fault for trying strange solutions.<br><br>Besides, the graphics are absolutely gorgeous to look at, and I found the story and dialogue well written (mind you, characters use the F-words frequently, so, if that bothers you, you might want to stay away; and the main character has "plot blindness" for a while, but that is oh-so-common in all media).<br><br>Some flaws: the game severely limits your ability to go explore the environment, using many artificial walls; but that might be a good thing -- the "space station" environments, which do allow some exploration, are graphically pretty but very empty and lifeless (nearly non-interactable), which comes across as very boring. I would rather have limited but interesting exploration than lots of freedom to do boring stuff (looking at you, collectibles).<br><br>But all in all, an enjoyable puzzle game, not as creative as Portal or The Talos Principle (in part because there are very few different puzzle mechanics), but still a nice romp, with an interesting story. Score: 82/100.			</div>

																想了半天还是给了差评，类似传送门的箱庭解密，但是和传送门比有其型却无其神，后期难度不在关卡设计上，在于碎，一个小关就是几个解密拼一起，一个屋子就是为了把里面的一个箱子拿出来而已，就算做成一个单独的关卡都没啥问题，但是由于摆放，空间位置等让你不好发现，而且这种情况越到后面越严重，难度都在找线头，每关都不是一个整体所以越往后玩越折磨。更不用说那个中间给你个中转站连所有地铁的地图设计，还没有引导系统，很容易迷路加绕路			</div>

																If you like cube and physics based problem solving games like Talos Principle, Portal and Quantum Conundrum, then you'll like this too.<br>Big game with many hours of play - don't forget to play the 2 extras as well, as these also add additional game mechanics, and are quite long games in their own right.			</div>

																Juego largo de plataformas y puzzles empleando el magnetismo y la gravedad. Cuenta ♥♥♥ una historia interesante aunque algo mejorable. Los escenarios visualmente muy disfrutables. Hay algún error que otro como que no hay sonido al caminar por la nave, irrelevante pero apreciable.<br><br>A mí no me ha hecho falta, pero es cierto que no vendría mal una manera mejor de guiarse por la nave para acceder a los diferentes niveles.<br><br>Lo recomiendo.			</div>

																Relicta is a pretty good physics puzzle game. It wouldn't have the broader appeal of the Portal games but for fans of these type of games it may be worthwhile.<br><br>The puzzles are of pretty good quality. At it's heart it revolves around manipulating magnetism and gravity to move cubes around to the right switches. The puzzles are challenging but generally manageable. Some of the puzzles once you get further in to the game are quite convoluted and can be a bit overwhelming to take in once you first enter a puzzle area. But with looking around and a bit of trial and error it's usually possible to break the steps to complete it down. That said I did on occasion have to consult a video guide to figure some parts out. But it was usually a case where I was stuck on one specific part of a puzzle and could usually figure the rest once I'd seen how to do the part that was troubling me.<br><br>The areas the test tracks are set in look really nice too. The game is set on the Moon but most of the puzzles take place in biome domes so rather than doing the test tracks in sterile lab rooms you'll find yourself in an icy biome or a jungle one and I thought this variation in scenery helps especially as it's a fairly long game.<br><br>It's the parts in between the puzzles that are kind of dull. When moving from one biome to another you'll find yourself running around samey corridors to find the train in the next area. Even though there are collectable items and logs in these areas it just feels like padding. The story just isn't interesting enough to make those inbetween bits worthwhile. <br><br>In fact at times the story feels hilariously disconnected from the actual gameplay. The story is basically about an alien lifeform taking over the moonbase and it feels more appropriate for a shlocky 00's sci fi first person shooter rather than a physics puzzle game. It often doesn't really make sense why your character is just going through the motions and solving puzzles when all that is going on in the background. Also all the human characters are quite annoying.<br><br>But I dont want to be too harsh because even while I didn't like the story parts of the game, you can tell a lot of heart went into the game. The puzzles I enjoyed, even if the main campaign feels a bit long. If you are still itching for more puzzles there's also two short extra campaigns which are a free addition so thats a nice touch too. All in all it's not an amazing game but I liked it overall and would recommend if you fancy a some physics based puzzles.			</div>

																SINTESI DEL GAMEPLAY<br><br>Relicta è un FPP il cui game design si fonda sull'uso dell'attrazione gravitazionale degli oramai classici cubi da puzzle, quasi sempre presenti in molti titoli del genere. Potrete caratterizzare a piacimento i cubi donando loro due tra le forze gravitazionali disponibili (se diverse attraggono, se identiche respingono) e decidendo anche se debbano risentire o no della gravità del terreno. Potrete caricare magneticamente anche alcune postazioni fisse utili ad attirare o respingere i cubi. <br><br>Diversi campi di forza permettono diversi tipi di interazione: bloccano solo i cubi, o solo il nostro personaggio o entrambi. La meccanica dei puzzle ci chiede di sfruttare il peso dei cubi per interagire ♥♥♥ degli interruttori che cambiano la funzionalità dei campi di forza, creando in pratica una logica "chiave/porta" per permetterci di uscire dai livelli. Potremo interagire anche ♥♥♥ dei robot capaci di muoversi seguendo percorsi prestabiliti e capaci di annullare le funzionalità dei cubi come anche di trasportarli. <br><br>Esistono anche interruttori semplici e a tempo per modificare, similmente a quelli a pressione, la logica funzionale del livello. La curva della difficoltà è tra le più lente mai viste nel genere: il numero di camere è molto elevato ma per molte ore di gioco la vita sarà molto facile e il difficile arriverà veramente solo nelle ultime fasi di gioco. Il gioco però rimane ♥♥♥ un livello di difficoltà più medio che alto perché i pattern di risoluzione possibili sono sempre un po' già scritti nella posizione degli oggetti interagenti: ♥♥♥ una logica trial and error potenzialmente si risolverebbe quasi tutto, soprattutto agli inizi.<br><br>ESTRO ARTISTICO<br><br>Se in The Talos Principle il level design alternava estetiche provenienti da diverse architetture archeologiche storiche, in Relicta si alterneranno invece diversi tipi di biomi terrestri. Sono le ambientazioni naturali a fare da sfondo alle meccaniche di gioco donando suggestioni naturali molto funzionali alla tranquillità necessaria per affrontare le varie prove. <br><br>La narrazione ci vede sostanzialmente soli come accade per la maggior parte di tutti i giochi FPP... soli ma sempre in compagnia di qualcosa di subdolo ovviamente. In questo senso la storia tocca anche alcuni punti di originalità. Non c'è molta varietà musicale ma le dolcissime e tristi note che accompagnano tutta l'esperienza si rendono complici dei sentimenti paradossali che si generano affrontando profonde e pericolose insidie all'interno di paesaggi naturali bellissimi.  <br><br>PRO<br><br>Gioco molto longevo. Storia ben caratterizzata. Estetica del level design molto evocativa. Meccaniche dei puzzle appaganti.<br><br>CONTRO<br><br>Anche troppo lungo. La meccanica dei puzzle svela ♥♥♥ troppa facilità i pattern di risoluzione degli stessi. Troppi livelli eccessivamente semplici (sarebbe stato meglio farne un numero minore ma più difficili)			</div>

																Puzzles are quite good, but there are a few levels that could have used a bit more play testing - you can skip some mechanics or brick the level and you'll be forced to restart the puzzle. Most of the time they are short enough so this is not an issue, but it was especially painful when it happened for me on one of the last puzzles that is quite large and I had to replay it again. It can be infuriating.<br><br>That being said, the game is ~17 hours long. Even if the puzzles are based around the same core mechanics, each new level presents a new variation that keeps you thinking. The last few levels can look complicated and even messy, but on further inspection they are just several puzzles stitched together that are solved one at a time. These can be daunting, but the difficulty is manageable.<br><br>Story is OK. Sound and voice is good. The only thing to note is that there are no footsteps sound when you're running around the ship.			</div>

																Ein Portal-Clone, aber einer von der besseren. Wer Physik-basierte Rätsel mag, hier mit viel Magnetismus, der sollte es sich mal anschauen, alle anderen: Finger weg.<br><br>Was leider völlig sinnlos ist, ist die Story. Wem das egal ist, der kann ein paar nette Stunden verbringen. Meins ist es nicht.<br><br>Ich gebe trotzdem eine positive Bewertung, weil es gut gemacht ist, auch, wenn es nicht meinen Geschmack trifft. Ich hab's übrigens unter Epic gespielt, und da etwa drei Stunden.			</div>

																Medium to hard puzzles, sometimes requiring to think outside of introduced game mechanics. A bit of platforming or timing-based stuff, but mostly no rush. Mildly interesting storyline. Quality product for puzzle lowers, but might be too hard for those without puzzle games experience or creative mind.			</div>

																Très bon jeu, les casse-têtes nécessitent de manipuler la gravité et la polarité des éléments du décors afin d'être résolus. Comme dans beaucoup jeu de ce type la difficulté montre crescendo, les niveaux des derniers DLC sont assez retors pour certains. La durée de vie avec les 2 DLC est excellente, j'en suis à 31h au moment de poster l'évaluation et je n'ai pas fini le 1er DLC.			</div>

																Ein komplett unterschätzes und viel zu wenig beachtetes Spiel. Wer auf "First Person Puzzle Games" steht, kann hier bedenkenlos zugreifen. Der Schwierigkeitsgrad steigt kontinuierlich an, die Story ist interessant und der Umfang des Hauptspiels ist mehr als gut. Dazu kommen noch die 2 kostenlos erschienenen DLCs.<br><br>Der einzige Kritikpunkt den ich habe, ist, dass es leider keine Level bzw Kapitelauswahl gibt. Sobald ein abschnitt fertig ist, kann man nicht zu früheren abschnitten zurück kehren. Das ist unter anderem auch deswegen schade, da man so "Collectables" die man übersehen hat, in einem neuen Spieldurchlauf einsammeln muss.<br><br>Abgesehen hiervon aber wirklich ein sehr schönes Spiel			</div>

																Played for 6 hours so far, probably 35, 40% of the way through. Some quite challenging puzzles, nothing too hard yet, a lot of new mechanics thrown at you with no hints however it does kind of make a tutorial out of each new mechanic in the sense that you will learn it yourself &amp; then continue to use it. I've only been stumped on one level so far but because of the games' physics it allows you to experiment in a bunch of different ways to find the right solution. I'm sure I've completed some levels in non-intended ways which is actually fun. <br>Would Recommend, 8/10<br>(Received through a humble bundle subscription)			</div>

																Solid graphics and performance, an although cliche story of an alien entity found on the moon but there's a mystery to it and it it is presented by a solid voice cast. The dialog could use fewer edgy f bombs though and a less angsty protagonist. There are also datapads littered around the game in random places, with a wealth of background information that is just a poor and passé design and really something that should have been weaved in to the overall narrative more fluidly.<br><br>The core of the game is ultimately the puzzle solving, but by the time I made it roughly half way through the game and hit the Glacier Test Track, I had had more than enough of them and was ready for the story to truly unfold at that point and not continue to have it served up piecemeal.<br><br>Given the perhaps physics nature of the puzzles, or due largely to their design, too many of their solutions ends being affected by randomness or unpredictable cube behavior, or dexterity/timing check, leading to a repetition that adds to the tedium of the puzzle designs.<br><br>The puzzles becomes more and more tedious as you progress through increasingly convoluted and confusing map designs, that just serves to drag out the game and ultimately overstay their welcome.<br><br>Ultimately solving the puzzles doesn't feel rewarding in the end, more so they offer a sense of relief from the tedium of not having to go them again, until the game serves up another more tedious puzzle. And the satisfaction in solving the puzzles is really why you play a puzzle solver game in the first place, right?			</div>

																중력과 자기장을 활용해서 클리어가 가능한 퍼즐 게임입니다.<br>초중반까지는 적당히 머리를 써서 깰 수 있다면 어느 지점부터 피지컬이 필요하게 되고, 3D라 위치잡기도 까다롭게 되는 것 때문에 클리어하기 난해하게 됩니다.<br>일단 기본 스토리는 다 클리어 했지만... 추가 컨텐츠는 너무 과하게 피지컬이나 머리를 쓰게 되서 못하겠더군요.<br><br>어느 정도 피지컬이 된다는 분들 중에 퍼즐을 좋아하는 분들이라면 나쁘지 않은 게임이라고 생각됩니다.			</div>

																Relicta es un juego de puzzles al más puro estilo Portal pero ♥♥♥ su propia personalidad que lo diferencia del resto. El magnetismo es la base principal sobre lo que gira todo, aunque es mucho más complejo de lo que pueda parecer.<br><br>El juego nos narrá una historia de experimentos científicos en la luna donde vamos descubriendo cierta trama de ciencia ficción. Está bien que hayan intentado meter historia a un juego de este tipo y se agradece que haya ciertas conversaciones o intenten darle sentido a lo que hacemos, pero no deja de ser una excusa para el grueso del juego que es completar puzzles cada vez más complejos y desafiantes.<br><br>El juego se divide en varias zonas  que a su vez incluyen cierta cantidad de puzzles en un área establecida. Cuando completas el desafío de esa área desbloqueando la puerta de salida avanzas a la siguiente área y así hasta completar toda la zona. Después de acabar una zona regresas a tu estación principal para buscar tu siguiente destino. Entre zona y zona puedes tener alguna conversación de historia o buscar algunos coleccionables.<br><br>Un primer punto a destacar son las distintas ambientaciones y zonas dentro del juego. Las áreas donde están los puzzles se integran ♥♥♥ el bioma de la zona donde te encuentras. Así nos encontramos interiores o exteriores de zonas de jungla, desierto o nevadas ♥♥♥ distintos niveles de altura y elementos y objetos a combinar para resolver los puzzles. Se agradece mucho esta variedad de ambientes. Se hace más agradable a la vista y menos monótono que si todo se desarrolla en cámaras de pruebas de interiores claustrofóbicos como otros juegos del mismo género.<br><br>A lo largo del juego se utiliza el recurso habitual de irte añadiendo poco a poco nuevos elementos o estructuras que interaccionan ♥♥♥ los puzzles para hacer la resolución más compleja pero a la vez más gratificante. Al principio tendrás sólo cubos y magnetismo, pero luego se añadirán plataformas móviles, robots que mueven cubos, etc<br><br>A veces cuando has acabado de completar un puzzle complejo y llegas al siguiente puzzle de área puede llegar abrumar encontrarte decenas de estructuras, cubos, palancas, plataformas, donde a simple vista no le ves ningún sentido pero que poco a poco al explorar iras desentrañando como ir completándolo.<br><br>Los puzzles son complejos, pero la dificultad esta ajustada. ♥♥♥ paciencia y razonamiento se podrán ir completando. Algunas veces dan más sensación de dificultad de lo que en realidad son. En algunas ocasiones intentas buscar una solución compleja a una situación que es mucho más simple, pero lo mejor es darte cuenta que los diseñadores del puzzle probablemente pensaron que cometerías ese error y no caerías en la solución más obvia complicándote la vida . Otras veces te ocurrirá lo contrario, pensarás que es más fácil de lo que es y estás 10 minutos dando vueltas.<br><br>El apartado visual cumple sin alardes. Los paisajes del juego, tanto de jungla, nevados o desérticos están bien realizados y son agradables a la vista. Algo más flojos y monótonos son los interiores de la nave principal que hacen de enlace ♥♥♥ las distintas zonas del juego pero donde no hay puzzles y sólo estarás de paso.<br><br>Sobre la música y sonidos el juego los utiliza en la justa medida. Los sonidos te ayudan a saber que estás aplicando efectos de magnetismo a cubos y otros elementos o los pulsadores y temporizadores que vas utilizando para guiarte, no hace falta mucho más. Agradezco que apenas haya música, sobretodo en las áreas puzzles, sustituyéndose por el sonido de ambiente de la zona. Mejor para pensar ♥♥♥ calma y concentrarte.<br><br>Relicta además tiene una duración considerable para este tipo de juegos. Sin usar ninguna guía y tomándomelo ♥♥♥ calma y buscando todos los coleccionables y objetos de historia me duró unas 21 horas. Además hay contenido adicional gratuito que estoy probando ahora donde estoy encontrándome alguno de los puzzles más complejos del juego y que tras completar algunas áreas estimo darán varias horas de juego adicionales.<br><br>No se si en principio estos contenidos adicionales se pensó en lanzarlos como dlcs de pago y finalmente se han dejado gratuitos porque al jugarlos parecen contener suficiente contenido y calidad para pagar por ellos.<br><br>Me sorprende y entristece que a pesar de que el juego tiene reseñas muy positivas en general, la cantidad de reseñas total es muy pequeña, lo que me hace pensar que el juego no se ha vendido tan bien como debería. Una pena porque es un juego largo, cuidado, ♥♥♥ puzzles muy bien pensados y variados, que en definitiva hará disfrutar a los amantes de los puzzles y desafíos, a los cuales no les debería faltar este juego en su colección.			</div>

																Relicta is one of the better first person puzzle games, but still a far cry from Portal 2.<br><br>The visuals are fine, the story is ok, and conversations are mostly nicely written, and sometimes have some great puns.<br><br>However, the puzzles quickly turn from fun into chore (which is evident by the fact that 70% of the players completed the first area, only 40% completed the second area, and then less than 20% completed the next one, with only 10% of the people finishing the game).<br><br>Even when you do everything correctly, sometimes a box fluctuates just a bit away, making you miss the button or a platform, and forcing you to redo part of the challenge (and that's not because of bad performance, I had stable 60 fps). Furthermore, the game has a lot of minor issues with collisions, which become more and more evident and infuriating as the puzzles become more complex and longer to finish.<br><br>Finally, some puzzles are divided into clear stages, but those stages don't have checkpoints between them. Since some puzzles could easily take you half an hour to figure out (withot using a solution, of course), you then have to redo part of those if you have to go away from the game. In my case the game crashed once in the middle of a puzzle, just after a spot that could've easily been a checkpoint, so I had to spend 5-10 minutes to redo the first part of the puzzle. And again, it took 5-10 minutes only because I already knew how to complete that part optimally.<br><br>So overall, while Relicta is certainly not a bad game, it has its flaws which make it far less enjoyable than it could be had the developers added more checkpoints and polished controls/physics more.			</div>

																This game is actually very good and entertaining with puzzles even if it keeps falling between chapters due to repetitive tasks, so it's taking me long time to proceed. <br>Admittedly it's wrapped in a beautiful graphic, both inside the base and outside in the various biomes. Even sounds and voice acting are great but... WHY that pointless tsunami of profanities tempesting all along the game? 65% of the words being spoken are profanities.			</div>

																A fun puzzle game. The puzzles have a nice rate of increase in difficulty, and doesn't fall into being so simple that it doesn't pose some challenge. The voice acting for the game is also really solid, and the mid-game twist brings a very fun series of exchanges and interactions from then on.			</div>

																The world is great, the story is alright. Most of the puzzles are fine, but they are physic based. That means that sometimes you got to fiddle with the magnet fields to make them go at, what it feels, not the correct way, but is. I don't like that there is not a clear and consistent way to solve some of those puzzles. It seems sloppy at times.			</div>

																I like puzzle games, but this one falls short. I keep having to repeat the same solution multiple times, not because what I'm doing is wrong, but because the games physics is too unpredictable. The story, which is usually the hook for me, was very lack luster and a lot of the world is presented in text documents. The story is also very strange. You're trying to save people's lives, but there's cube puzzles standing between you and your friends freezing to death. You ask the game to turn off the puzzles so you can save the lives of the people who work for the company, but the game tells you if you do that it's going to snitch on you and you'll get in trouble... for trying to save lives and not complete 50 cube puzzles when time is critical. O...K...<br><br>Also, the lady who I think is your best friend, cusses you out every time you talk to her. She's a massive a*hole and the dialogue between them is not engaging or enjoying.			</div>

																Story is bland and transparent. The language of the characters seems forced and jarring. The areas between the puzzles although pretty, are so similar I found myself getting lost. <br><br>Puzzles are forgettable and tedious.  This might seem like nick picking, but I feel it's important. There is this one puzzle in portal, where there are a series of elevated platforms. You bounce up an down while making your way up. I always think of that puzzle when portal is brought up. It was fun, it was memorable, it's one of the many reasons I recommend that game.  The puzzles in this are like a game of Simon, you start off with a few steps to complete the puzzle. The next puzzle is the same as the previous, except there is a new step at the end. <br><br>I wouldn't say it's a bad game, but I will not recommend it to anyone.			</div>

																I have a love-hate relationship with this game. On one side, I like how it really goes deep into the base mechanics of the puzzles by not adding almost any extra feature alongside the whole game, and just exploring how the different elements work together and how you can exploit some of the physics involved.<br><br>Buuuuut then the puzzles are longer and more tedious the further into the campaign you are, reaching a point where, when you enter a new puzzle and see such quantity of elements all packed into a tiny space, knowing that if you decide to take on the challege you have to do it in one go because there are no checkpoints mid-puzzle or saving features, that your brain just says "please don't".<br><br>But in the end I've liked the game and, with the free DLCs they released, this is one of the few puzzle games that has given me over 20 hours of handcrafted playtime, so I can't really not recommend it.			</div>

If you are planning to buy this, buy on sale. It's definetly not worth 20 bucks.<br>			</div>

																This game is enjoyable, but I don't find the puzzles as satisfying as a lot of similar FPS puzzle games. Often they seem to rely on quirks rather than logical deductions.<br><br>I also don't particularly care about the narrative, but for this type of game it's definitely not make or break. For me its hard to be as engrossing as Portal 2 or even Lightmatter.<br><br> Definitely worth the sale price though!<br><br>Edit: Honestly the puzzles completely lost my interest like 1/3 or 1/2 through and I'm not even going to finish the game.			</div>

																Nice puzzle game, even though quite unpolished. Graphics is great! Story is fine... but you can totally feel that this is another of those games that was made for console and then forced onto PC. Also for Physics-based puzzler this game has HORRIBLE arcade physics! Also a LOT of part of the game do not make any sense, it is a bit mess ...Still the game is not bad			</div>

																got to give it a thumbs down. especially after trying my damnest to use the keyboard/mouse and even controller after reading the constant reviews. it shows some promise, but the lack of consistent physics with the boxes i can only imagine the buggy mess when given even more to interact with and control/manipulate.. and im not looking forward to that cluster f**k of a mess and would rather give myself a hard pass and some tylenol for the effort i put in so far.<br><br>not worth the effort. by any means. boring interactive enviroments. seemed more like a physics puzzle test lab for throwing some ideas in with a lamented story thrown in afterwards for half a**ed good measure too. so theres 2 against it. and the third, every single area: devoid of life, other then the puzzle areas, which are aswell, if you dont count the blocks. lol. and the folks doing the voice overs.. half the time i would read subtitles and they were supposed to talk.. and nothing came out, then the game would skip forward in conversation and i would have missed a ton of "content and story" meh.<br><br>i really wanted to like this game, but for real a game like this needs to invite you in, and have a bit more substance.. not run folks away with the at best child like interpretation of physics, and adapt the concept to 3 buttons and make the game fight with you at every turn to utilize the concept and button presets.			</div>

																The game has story and puzzles, sadly they are completely separated and mostly unrelated.<br><br>1. The story plays a "graphic novel", and "walkie talkie" discussions. <br>2.

																I had this sitting in my library for a while, started it on whim, and boy am I glad I did.<br><br>If you liked The Talos Principle, and to a certain degree the Portal series, then you're gonna love this first person puzzler.<br><br>The presentation, as in, graphics and voicework are all top-notch, but the writing and story is pretty C-grade terrible (it gets better in the two free addons that comes with the game), but all that doesn't matter at all, because the quality and challenge of the puzzles were more than enough to keep me solidly hooked and playing nothing but Relicta until I completed all three missions, and got all achievements (except the speedrun one)<br><br>In short, if you like 3D first-person puzzle solving, then this one is a guaranteed hit!			</div>

																I thought this was a moderately good first person puzzle game. It may be worth playing if you like the genre and have already played Portal 1&amp;2 and the Talos Principle (if not, go play those first). It has some strong aspects and some weak aspects, which probably reflects a relatively smaller team or lower budget.<br><br>Strong aspects:<br>The puzzles. The game's core mechanics of magnetism and gravity manipulation work pretty well and I never found the game either getting too unintuitive. The maps are pretty well designed. It's completely linear, but I never really got stuck, but also didn't feel like it was unchallenging.<br>The graphics. It's a little bit generic looking, but it's pretty. <br>The challenge and length. The game was hard enough to be worthwhile but not so hard it was obnoxious (which can easily happen with puzzle games) and it didn't outstay its welcome.<br><br>Weaker aspects:<br>The writing. Oh, god, the writing. The plot and setting is ok, I guess, not amazing or anything. But the DIALOGUE, dear lord. Every single character talks like a 20 year old techbro. And they swear constantly, even in internal communications and memos, which feels extremely out of character for a bunch of scientists in a corporate environment (maybe in their personal lives, sure, but not in workplaces communications!) Maybe it just got mangled when they were translating it to English?<br>The voice acting. It's mostly just tolerable, but there is one character for which it is kind of laughable. You'll know it when you get to it.<br>The collectibles and hub area. They're pretty perfunctory and just there to be there. Doesn't hurt anything but doesn't add much.<br><br>So basically, play it for the puzzles and gameplay, not so much the plot.			</div>

																Slightly uninspired puzzle platformer which feels a bit like a cross between Portal and The Witness.<br><br>Pros: <br>-Pretty long and many puzzles - You'll get quite a lot of game for your money. I think 12 hours of puzzles is quite possible even if you're a regular on this kind of games.<br>-Looks beautiful - The open colorful levels are quite a relief compared to some other puzzle-platformers.<br><br>Neutral: <br>-Puzzles in the first half, didn't feel inspiring or challenging. They IMHO get better later on, but "later" means 6-7 hours, so you might need some perseverance to get to the better parts. And even then there's some levels that are just long, not good or challenging.<br><br>♥♥♥♥:  <br>-Invisible Walls: looks beautiful, but thanks to a lot of invisible walls it often feels even more restricted than other some other puzzle-platformers. <br>-Story. Not many characters and no story development for the first 2-3 hours and once something happens? The protagonist pretends nothing happened for the next 2-3 hours. And even after this, it felt like someone had a pretty cool idea for a story, but decided not to inject a sense of urgency or suspense in an otherwise relaxed puzzle game. So they toned it down. <br><br>Undecided whether to give it a thumbs up or down. It's very medicore, but as I have to give either up or down...			</div>

																I'm decently far in now and I just need to say Relicta is extremely underrated. Seriously, there's less than 100 positive reviews despite effectively being on par with other 3D puzzlers such as Talos—it does a couple things better, like the puzzles are crafted more fairly with the environment properly hinting towards intended actions, and the difficulty curve is close to perfect, forcing you to learn the right things at the right time or place. It's <b>really</b> lacking music <i>(play your own maybe)</i>. The story is very questionable, with shoddy English, incoherent gibberish and awkwardly forced F-bombs, but pretentious gibberish is honestly par for the course with its competition. A few more mechanics get introduced farther into the game.<br>The graphics are beautiful, it runs well, puzzles are consistent and there's plenty of content.<br>Early game has a few "hidden" cubes you should look out for that may confuse you.			</div>

																I'm enjoying it so far. I don't mind the walking sim story stuff, though it does seem a bit disconnected from the puzzle stuff. The puzzles are good. It's kinda a bit too obvious to make comparisons to Portal, Turing Test, Talos Principle and Lightmatter; Relicta can stand proudly alongside them as a very worthwhile addition to the genre. <br><br>There are a lot of criticism here saying it's just ripping off Portal and them complaining that it's not Portal. It's a bit like saying that a pizza is just a flat open sandwich and them complaining that it's not a good sandwhich.			</div>

																If you like puzzle games, I'd say this one is a must. First-person puzzle game which is clearly inspired by games such as Portal and The Talos Principle. It's not a good as those, but still worth your time no doubt. The puzzles are cleverly designed and work pretty well despite being mostly physics based, which will sometimes lead to an undesired outcome even if you did the right steps, but this happened very rarely to me. The story is interesting, even if the ending is a bit weak.<br><br>Game also includes 2 extra chapters, which could perfectly be sold as DLC, but they are included in the game, points for the devs for that.<br><br>Conclusion: if you're into puzzle games, stop reading reviews already and go play it !			</div>

																Relicta is a 3D physics based puzzle game with puzzles revolving around magnetism. You can switch the color objects from Red to Blue so that they attract/repel each other. The game is fairly good overall. The voice acting, plot, assets, physics, and game design are fairly high quality.<br><br>The game follows a linear difficulty curve, but I think it would have been better to have a few difficult puzzles mixed in early on as long as they were optional. The odd thing about this game is that the first half feels like a different game than the second. Not only does the plot completely change, but the puzzles required more out of the box thinking. I liked the changes to the puzzles, but I'm not so sure about the story. <br><br>The game also forces you to take breaks every 5 puzzles by making you walk around a facility to find the next zone. This is where you obtain collectibles and notes. I was fine with this at first but eventually felt like a pointless task since every transition felt the same.<br><br>			</div>

																It's an okay puzzle game. Played the main story and now waiting for bonus content patch. Will not try speedrunning it.<br><br>While playing, I did not feel excitement but tediom when going to the next puzzle set in each level. Puzzles get longer and a bit more convoluted, sometimes with obscure steps I could not figure out myself. There are a few puzzles requiring very accurate placement or timing of actions.			</div>

																Sehr cooler, cleverer und humorvoller Puzzle-Plattformer in wirklich hübschen Umgebungen. Die Rätsel sind innovativ und fast immer gut durchdacht, auch wenn sich die Lösungen an manchen Stellen nicht so rund und befriedigend anfühlen wie bei den großen Genre-Vertretern Portal oder Talos Principle. Für Puzzle-Freund nichtsdestotrotz ein absoluter Geheimtipp!			</div>

																Ein sehr guter Physikpuzzler, der es nebenher auch schafft, genügend Story stimmig einzubetten, die meine Handlungen nicht sinnlos und nur um der Puzzles willen erscheinen lassen. Mein Charakter wird dadurch greifbar für mich und verbindlich. Rätselfreunde dieser Art von Spielen dürften hier voll auf ihre Kosten kommen und sich garantiert nicht unterfordert fühlen.			</div>

																Ein sehr schönes Spiel.<br>Die Rätsel werden mit der Zeit wirklich knackig.<br><br>Pro:<br>Durch die Spielmechanik der Würfel ( Magnetismus, Schweben usw. ) eröffnen sich viele Möglichkeiten ein/e  Abschnitt/Testkammer zu lösen.<br>Die Grafik ist sehr gelungen.<br>In den Zwischenbereichen der Testkammern sind malerische Landschaften zu  bewundern. <br>Die Musik - überzeugt. Für mich nicht aufdringlich und dem eigentlichem Rätseln angepasst.<br>Contra;<br>Die Story plätschert vor sich hin und hat nicht wirklich mein Interesse geweckt. ( aber die Story war ja auch nicht das Kaufkriterium für mich )<br>So schön wie die Basisstation auch kreiert wurde , ist sie für meinen Geschmack doch zu groß ausgefallen.<br>- Wenn ich mich an einem Rätsel die Zähne ausbeiße kann das schon mal Stunden dauern - ein ganzen Abschnitt paar Tage. ( da kann man schon mal die vorherigen Laufwege in der Basis vergessen ) <br>Aber über diese kleine Manko kann ich hinwegsehen.<br>Für mich ein klares Daumen hoch, für dieses Game.<br>Abschließend : Habe das  Game jetzt  durchgespielt - Phantastisch.<br>Die beiden kostenlosen Erweiterungen, sind Super.			</div>

																Si has jugado El Pincipio de Talos y El Camino a Gehenna y te gustó, te gustará este juego. Aunque la historia es completamente diferente, los puzzles son básicamente los mismos.  No digo que sean iguales, pero muy parecidos. Puedes reprogramar las teclas a tu conveniencia lo que facilita mucho la jugabilidad, sobre todo para mí que en estos momentos he de utilizar el ratón ♥♥♥ la mano izquierda. Y además es un juego hecho en España, por valencianos. Lo recomiendo 100 %.			</div>

																If you’re looking for the next Portal game then this ain’t it, but Relicta might just scratch that itch for a clever physics-based puzzle adventure.  Best of all, Relicta makes you feel smart…if not immediately, eventually.  I enjoyed exploring the concepts of magnetism and gravity and the clever use of switch pads and teleporters to defeat some truly mind-melting puzzles, often in ways I’m sure the designers weren’t expecting.  If you’re even considering this game you likely have some experience with the genre and know what to expect, and those expectation will be fully realized and more when you explore the intriguing world of Relicta.<br><br>Full review at <a class="bb_link" href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fgamechronicles.com%2Fvideo-games%2Frelicta-review-pc%2F" target="_blank" rel=" noopener">http://gamechronicles.com/video-games/relicta-review-pc/</a><br>Live gameplay video at <div class="dynamiclink_box " onclick="DynamicLink_PlayYouTubeVideoInline( this, &quot;7pPtYMCccvE&quot; );">

																I give a HUGE recommendation for Relicta. REALLY HUGE. It's one of those games where you bang at a puzzle for 45 minutes straight, solving challenges one by one until you see how everything fits together. I'd describe it as blending parts of Talos Principle with Magnetic: Cage Closed, then mixing in some similarities from Q.U.B.E. and Magrunner: Dark Pulse.<br><br>Yup, my favorite cube-type 3rd generation Portal family all wrapped into one game. Cubes on pads, cubes on triggers, flinging cubes, flying on cubes, magnetizing cubes, moving platforms, different types of barriers, etc. Gameplay has a hint of training on each new concept, relying much more on your creative puzzle-solving abilities. i.e. - Sometimes you will have to do a simple task, learning a concept. Other times, you can be in the middle of a level and think "Hey, I wonder if I can do it this way  ... "  I counted 6 times when I wanted to peek at a walkthrough, but found that perseverance got me 100% through the difficult parts.<br><br>The environments are varied, which is good. Audio is great, and background music is well produced. My GeForce 1080 handled the game fine at 2560x1440.<br><br>Bad things? Not much. The game's opening has an intro with some chords that sound like my speakers are blowing out. I got stuck a few times (three times a glitch I couldn't get past, and twice because I thought I was stuck but actually just needed some more effort), but there's a level reset command which will put you back to the last savegame. That's a bit of a weakness: the savegame gets stretched out in the last half of the game. Levels can be 3 or 4 parts, but the save point reset will return you back a half-hour of progress (which you should be able to get through in 5, now). And there's an achievement for a speedrun. Ugh. Not going to happen.			</div>

																Amazing. This game visually reminds me of the Talos Principle with its mix of beautiful natural environments and technology. The puzzles start simple and get progressively more and more complex, each set of levels introducing some new mechanic. It helps the game not to get stale and repetitive and shows that some thought has been put into the game design.<br><br>The story is captivating and really pushed me through the puzzles as I was eager to get to next part and the one after that and another one after that. It even has some really funny moments and two endings that you can choose from.<br><br>Visually, the game looks amazing and is really well optimized. I have a pretty old rig (7 years at this point) and could run it on max settings fairly comfortably most of the time.<br><br>The game could use more music. There is some, but the game is mostly silent, sadly. It could also use some sort of a save feature when you don't have time to go through the whole level. It gets a bit tedious when you have to repeat what you've already solved, especially near the end where the levels are HUGE.<br><br>Overall, the game is amazing and a must-have if you like to solve puzzles. Highly recommended.			</div>

																Very complicated / multi-faceted puzzles, the solution to which is almost never immediately obvious. Many times I was left wondering if I had solved a puzzle the intended way, or if I had cheesed it with clever use of mechanics... there is not always a way to tell (unless you straight up don't use some puzzle elements, which happened to me several times), which is a great feeling. This game will undoubtedly be compared to Portal, because there are many similarities, but it holds its own in spite of that.<br><br>If I had to give it one ♥♥♥ it would be that I felt like I was constantly on a wild goose chase running from place to place to solve these damn puzzles when my friends and family desperately needed me! But that is really just a testament to how likable and believable the characters are - they tell a great story despite having a clear low budget and no human models in the whole game. It would have been satisfying to pay an extra $5 to see some of these people I connected with, even if it was just some CGI or otherwise animated epilogue.			</div>

																The puzzles are quite fun and sometimes I feel stupid for missing something very obvious. Some of the puzzles incorporate items from a previous puzzle. The game really challenges the way to think and I'm quite enjoying it. The story is interesting as well and actually have me paying attention to it. Would recommend this to anyone that likes physics based puzzles for sure. There are a few small bugs here and there but nothing that can't be overcome!			</div>

																Relicta is a first person puzzle game that let's you manipulate boxes found in test environments strewn over the world. You can make the box weightless or magnetize them to either of two polarities. There are magnetic plates strewn over the test courses that also have a polarity and either repel or attract boxes based on their polarity. The same goes for the boxes, allowing you to manipulate two boxes by their placement and (change of) polarity. Also you can ride on the boxes. Later teleports for the boxes, fields impassible for the boxes, configurable magnetic plates and other contraptions up the ante.<br><br>The gameplay is well realized and varied, with a not too easy difficulty I've enjoyed.<br><br>Sound is nothing to write home about, but the story, told in cutscenes and dialogues between tests and set pieces, is livened up by a good performance of the voice actors.<br><br>Graphics are nice, with a steady fps (that the game's physics engine also needs, so no suprise there). They are somewhat taxing on my a few years old high end graphics card, though.<br><br>So far (I'm four hours in at the time of writing) I'm enjoying myself, due to a competent presentation, interesting story and a good difficulty for engaging puzzle mechanics.<br><br>EDIT: I put the game on hold eventually because the designers commit one of the cardinal sins of (first person) puzzle design: relying on timed memorization of puzzle solutions far too much.<br><br>What I mean by that: at a certain point the difficulty of the game lies not that much in figuring out HOW to beat the puzzle, but being able to execute the solution as a sequence of turns, jumps and mouse clicks. All timed, of course.			</div>
