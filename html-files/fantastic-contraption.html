																'Fantastic Contraption' is a great puzzle game that is seriously hampered in later levels by many physics, UI, design, and quality issues. These issues are relatively minor, but ultimately extremely frustrating because of how many other things this game does so well.<br><br>It feels GREAT to just start grabbing pieces and building a contraption. The actual physical movements are intuitive, for the most part. When everything works together, you can enact your idea in no time flat. When your idea works, you're on cloud nine -- the physical nature of the building helps lend a feeling of true ownership and accomplishment when your contraption solves the puzzle at hand.<br><br>However, there are several issues that can dissolve the bond between idea and action. These issues are relatively minor, but as the puzzles get more complex, the uncertainty and instability caused by these issues turn a fun and engaging puzzle game into an exercise of sheer frustration.<br><br>As of this current version, here are my collection of issues that I have noted...<br><br><div class="bb_h1">Section 1: Lack of tutorialization or documentation</div>The only tutorials offered by the game are on basic control and interaction matters -- what the buttons on the controllers do, what the general goal of the puzzles are, what the various objects in the creation space are for, etc. Once the game has filled you in on those ideas, it utterly abandons you. There is no way to recall those prior pieces of information in-game.<br><br>Additionally, even the meager tutorials and help text are incomplete. Here are some super useful basic points the game never tells you:<br><ol>    <li>The difference between the 'wooden' and 'water' rods. Wooden rods collide with objects and building pieces, water rods do not. You have to read the FAQ on the game's website to find this out.<br>    </li><li>There is a sort of black-goo sphere on the underside of the cat. It will 'glue' joints together, and will slow down the wheels/motors. Again, this info is on the game's website -- not in-game<br>    </li><li>You can grab the building materials from around yourself instead of from the cat! Wood rods are behind your right shoulder, water rods behind the left shoulder. The sticky goo is 'in' your right ear. Wheels/motors are in your left ear (but for me, those don't work -- they don't rotate). These 'shortcuts' are AMAZINGLY useful if you know them. They are only documented in a talk given at a VR developers conference. Seriously. I found them because I watched a talk by the creator.</li></ol><br><div class="bb_h1">Section 2: Insufficient editing tools</div>The only 'tools' (or actions) available in-game are attaching objects to joints, detaching objects from joints, lengthening rods, moving individual objects, moving an entire contraption around, deleting' objects, and clearing the entire construction workspace. The two obvious additional actions sorely missing are undo/redo functionality, and part-duplication.<br><br>If for some reason, through your fault or not, your contraption becomes broken because of a bad edit -- you cannot roll back. All you can do is attempt to manually fix the issue. If the only causes of breaking contraptions were user error, this would be a minor point -- but those are not the only causes, something which I will return to at a later point.<br><br>Many times in the construction of your contraption, you will realize that you will have duplicate sub-sections in your design. Perhaps you want to build two side-pods on your block-pusher contraption, one on each side. There is no way to 'duplicate' a contraption (or a sub section). You just have to build it twice. Do you want to have 8 identical sub-modules? Have fun building that sub-module 8 times. I hope you don't mess one of them up.<br><br>At later levels in the game, it becomes clear a more advanced editing tool would be of use -- a 'grid' with a 'snap to grid' function. As a simple example, if you have 8 wheels that all need to be lined up on the same plane, and facing the same direction, you are now engaged in incessant fiddling. Without a snap-to-grid function, you are manually fiddling with every piece and connector to make sure they line up as needed. And although the precision of the VIve controllers are amazing, this quickly becomes a Sisyphean ordeal.<br><br><div class="bb_h1">Section 3: Editing/Physics Issues</div><br>As a starter, the process of attempting to remove a part connected to multiple joints is fiddly and imperfect. What you need to do is first grab the part to be disconnected, then with the other hand, grab a part similarly attached at the same joint. If you're lucky, the joint of the part you want disconnected simply disconnects. If you're unlucky, you've disconnected your part -- but you've also moved the original joint around in the process. You intended to just disconnect a joint, but have now possibly broken your contraption. This assumes that you grabbed the right part at all, which is hit-or-miss with dense contraptions. You likely just disconnected or moved an completely unrelated part by accident.<br><br>The game, while in the editing mode, will completely mangle your contraption if you are not careful. I've still not fully worked out the conditions, but I believe it occurs when you move your contraption (or sections of it) within  solid environmental blocks -- like the ground. What appears to happen, is that the game tries to move the parts away from the center of the solid object until they are no longer colliding with that object. Note I said parts, and not 'the entire contraption'.<br><br>So, if you are working on editing a large/complex contraption, and you make the mistake of putting part of it through the floor -- the section of your contraption that intersected the floor has now been 'crunched'. This is absolutely unacceptable. With a large/complex contraption, you may be moving and rotating it around a good amount, in order to work on different parts of it. You may not even have noticed you put part of your contraption within a solid environmental space while moving it around. You'll just notice at some point that your contraption has been broken, and now you have to manually fix the contraption -- if it's even worth it. Sometimes it's not, and you're better off just rebuilding it.<br><br>The worst part is, all these issues so far interact with each other to harm the experience. You want to make a 8-wheels-in-series vehicle to 'crawl' forward over some obstacles? Good luck getting all 8 of those wheels to all touch the ground at once. Good luck getting them to all point in the same direction -- because you cannot. One of your wheels is slightly off-center -- now your contraption meanders to the right when moving forward. Oh, when building your vehicle, you rotated the whole vehicle, and 3 of the wheels  intersected into the ground. Now those 3 wheels have crunched into each other. But you cannot just 'undo' -- you have to manually fix them. Now they'll never be in line again. You're better off just starting over.<br><br><div class="bb_h1">Section 4: Puzzle Issues</div>I've had several instances where I had a contraption  solve the puzzle, but the game did not recognize it. When I compared my methods to those used successfully by other players, it was clear my solution was valid -- but the game simply would not credit me with solving it.<br><br>My other puzzle issue is that the game allows you to move your contraption outside the 'construction' space before starting the contraption. This allows you to trivialize several puzzles. Why build a contraption to exit the space forward, retrieve the object, reverse course, and place the object in the goal? You can simply just 'lasso' the object outside the construction space with a really long rod with a loop at the end, and have the contraption drive towards the goal instead.<br><br><div class="bb_h1">Summary</div><br>The very fact I've written this detailed description of issues speaks to the fact the game is fun and engaging -- when it works. When it doesn't, it's a nightmare.			</div>

																Fantastic Contraption is interesting but isn't a "fun" game. If it came with your Vive, great, knock yourself out. The pure experience of playing in virtual reality should be enough to keep you engaged for hours, even if you aren't really having "fun". Otherwise, the asking price is outrageous and you should wait until it's on a deep sale.<br><br>Where the game falters is in the extremely limited pool of parts to build from. There are basically only two parts, wheels and beams. There are technically two types of beams, but the distinction rarely matters. Using these tools, you complete simple puzzles by building simple machines. You cannot control your vehicle in any way, so getting it to do what you want involves either making a vehicle that moves straight and pointing it in the right direction, or designing it so that it moves in a curve - and pointing it in the right direction. You're so limited it's hard to be clever, and <b>most puzzles come down to trial and error of adjusting the lengths of the beams until the vehicle moves just right.</b><br><br>In some cases it's easier not to make a contraption at all. I beat one level, where I needed to put a pink ball inside a pink cube that was far away, by attaching the ball to the end of a very long pole, swinging the pole around so that the ball was already inside the cube, and starting the level. The game pretends like you can only build within a limited area, but in reality you can make your parts as big as you want, and there's nothing to stop you from making a pole that stretches across the entire level.<br><br>The gameplay is very similar to Besiege, but with most of the features removed (though Besiege may have copied its gameplay from the original Fantastic Contraption 2D game). If you've played Besiege, you will find the gameplay of Fantastic Contraption much less intriguing. You may have loved the original 2D Fantastic Contraption, but the gameplay simply does not translate well to 3D. <br><br>FC has the worst menu ever designed by anyone. The person who designed the menu is a psycopath. You access the menu by putting on a helmet in the game, instead of pressing the menu button on the Vive controller like a sane developer would expect you to do. The menu itself is a cluster of complex 3D objects all jammed tightly together, so that if you don't have a large play area you will literally be stuck inside the objects that make up the menu and unable to see them clearly. The menu uses strange physics-based design - for example, to save a contraption, you pick up a tiny copy of it off of a table and drop it onto a spinning plate. The fact that the plate spins freely makes this difficult, and if you drop the piece it can bounce out of reach and now you aren't allowed to save your contraption. I think you are also supposed to be able to change levels from this menu, but I have no idea how. I can grab levels from another spinning plate and throw them at the walls, but I don't see a way to activate one. The menu is incredibly stupid, and the devs need to accept that it was a bad decision and abandon it instead of sticking with it just because they put time into it.<br><br>Despite the gameplay not being very good, the game is definitely engaging just because the experience of building a contraption by hand in VR is so new. The construction gameplay is very satisfying - it's easy to maneuver pieces exactly the way you want and the fact that you can be doing a separate thing with each hand is awesome. I get the impression that the developers got so caught up in the building mechanics that they forgot to come up with a fun gameplay concept.<br><br>If you got FC for free it will probably tide you over until you buy something enjoyable, but I definitely wouldn't recommend spending money on it. This game isn't even remotely worth $40. This is a $5 experience.			</div>

																I was pretty excited about this game… and, if you got this game came in the Vive bundle, then it's pretty cool to have just for the experience of building things in Virtual Reality. <br><br>But I have to say that the purchase price for the game is way out of proportion for what you actually get. <br><br>I was hoping for a VR version of Besieged (which is incredibly entertaining); but Fantastic Contraptions feels like a very watered down version that does not allow you to build anything really creatively useful to fulfilling the in-game goals. That saps all the fun right out of it.<br><br>The Virtual Reality part is done very well. It feels flawless and intuitive to move around in the environment, grab things, and put them together using both hands. But the gameplay does not feel complete. It seems as though Fantastic Contraption has the basics down (beams, wheels, building with two hands, VR environment) but is missing elements of gameplay to allow you to focus more on creativity rather than simply fiddling with basics to make the contraptions work properly. <br><br>A good example of this is that there is no way, as far as I can tell, to snap your wheels to be properly straight and aligned with one another. Because it's pretty much impossible for you to lay the wheels down perfectly straight by hand, your contraptions are often going to slowly turn one direction or another. You have to keep restarting the level and slightly twisting a wheel one direction or another until it works right. I'd rather spend my time trying to figure out a creative way to make my contraptions do the intended job than to mess around trying to get the basics to work (i.e. making the contraption drive straight). <br><br>To use Besieged as an example again, in Besieged there are so many fundamentally different ways to achieve the end goal that if you and a friend play it at the same time, it’s unlikely that your vehicles will look anything alike. But in Fantastic Contraption, there are so few parts and/or mechanics to draw upon that you only feel like there is one way to reach the in-game goal. <br><br>The VR is done really well in this game, and the basics feel well put together, clean and intuitive. It just does not feel like a full and complete game yet, and the current experience is not worth the asking price.			</div>

																Fantasitc Contraption ist schon so etwas wie ein alter Klassiker der VR-Spiele. Es ist das einzige VR-Spiel von Naorthway Games 2016 und mit der original Vive veröffentlicht worden. Damals war es eines der Vorzeigespiele für Immersion und physikalische Interaktivität in VR. Fantastic Contraption ist, wie viele wahrscheinlich wissen ein etwas seltsames Konstruktionsrätselspiel. <br><br>In Fantastic Contraption ist es unsere Hauptaufgabe ein rosa leuchtendes Kugelwesen an sein vorgegebenes Ziel zu bringen. Hört sich einfach an.Um den kleinen Ball aber ans Ziel zu bringen, müssen wir waghalsige Vehikel und sonstige Konstruktionen auf Rädern errichten. Gebaut wird natürlich mit den eigenen Händen und wer aufgrund des Alters gedacht hat, man bekommt nur popelige Vive-Controller zu sehen, kann sich beruhigen. Scheinbar gab es nach Erscheinen der Index ein update, das die Index-Controller nicht nur unterstützt, sondern auch eigene Modelle im Spiel zeigt. Sehr cool! <br><br> Unsere Fahrzeuge bestehen im Grunde nur aus drei verschiedenen Teilen, aus zwei Arten von Sticks und sich ständig bewegenden zylindrischen Rädern. Es mach Spaß die tollkühnen Gefährte zu sehen wie sie unweigerlich auf den Abgrund zusteuern, bis wir endlich genau DIE Änderung vorgenommen haben. Und die Kugel kommt ins Ziel. Befriedigenderes kann es nicht geben. Zum Glück gibt es 50 Level, was mehr ist, als ich wohl je schaffen werde, ohne die Geduld zu verlieren. Für Abwechslung in den Leveln ist durch Katapulte, Drahtseile, Aufzüge und viele schwer zu erreichende Ziele gesorgt. Alles in allem eine große aber lustige physikalische Herausforderungen.<br><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2637225054" class="dynamiclink_box modalContentLink  ugc" data-modal-content-sizetofit="true" data-appid="386690" data-publishedfileid="2637225054">

</a><br>Die Welt von Fantastic Contraption ist in der Tat etwas seltsam. Auf den ersten Blick wirkt sie wie eine normale spacige Spieleumgebung mit schwebenden Inseln und blauem Himmel. Wenn wir jedoch genau hinsehen, sehen wir im Hintergrund und am Himmel riesige teil etwas verstörende Figuren. Ich muss zugeben, dass ich etwas verwirrt war. Ansonsten ist die Grafik sehr einfach und nicht unbedingt detailliert, aber sehr liebevoll wenn auch eintönig.<br><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2637226275" class="dynamiclink_box modalContentLink  ugc" data-modal-content-sizetofit="true" data-appid="386690" data-publishedfileid="2637226275">

</a><br>Setzen wir übrigens die durchgeknallten In-Game-VR-Helme auf, kommen wir ins Menü, wo wir Level auswählen und Konstruktonen speichern und laden kann.

</a><br>Ganz verrückt wird es aber, wenn wir Bauen wollen. Unser Baumaterial holen wir uns von der süßen Neko-Katze. (Diese gibt es dann als SteamVR Home Gegenstand!) Durch getriggerte Fürze können wir die Inventar-Katze an die gewünschte Stelle lenken. Das macht das Spiel sehr unterhaltsam.<br><br>Die Lerkurve ist allerdings relativ steil.

Is the only VR game from Naorthway Games released in 2016 with the original Vive. At the time it was one of the flagship games for immersion and physical interactivity in VR. Fantastic Contraption, as many probably know, is a somewhat strange construction puzzle game. <br><br>In Fantastic Contraption, our main task is to get a pink glowing spherical creature to its given destination. To get the little ball to its destination, we have to build daring vehicles and other constructions on wheels. Of course, we build with our own hands, and if you thought that you'd only get to see paltry Vive controllers due to their age, you can rest assured. Apparently, there was an update after the release of the Index, which not only supports the Index controllers, but also shows own models in the game. Very cool! <br><br> Our vehicles are basically just three different parts, two types of sticks and constantly moving cylindrical wheels. It's fun to see the daredevil vehicles as they inevitably head for the abyss until we finally make just THAT change. And the ball hits the target. There can't be anything more satisfying. Fortunately, there are 50 levels, which is more than I'll probably ever get through without losing patience. Variety in the levels is provided by catapults, wire ropes, elevators, and lots of hard-to-reach targets. All in all, a great but fun physical challenge.<br><br>The world of Fantastic Contraption is indeed a bit strange. At first glance, it seems like a normal spacey game environment with floating islands and blue skies. However, if we look closely, we see giant partially somewhat disturbing figures in the background and sky. I have to admit that I was a bit confused. Otherwise, the graphics are very simple and not necessarily detailed, but very loving if monotonous.<br><br>By the way, if we put on the crazy in-game VR helmets, we get to the menu where we can select levels and save and load constructs. The VR helmets always look different, by the way, so we sometimes have a spacey one or a unicorn as a helmet. <br><br>But it gets really crazy when we want to build. We get our building material from the cute Neko cat. (This is then available as a SteamVR Home item!) By triggered farts we can direct the inventory cat to the desired location. This makes the game very entertaining.<br><br>The ler curve is relatively steep, though. Even after the tutorial, we'll certainly find ourselves pondering more often, wondering what to do. This will definitely put off less patient players, but if you stick with it, you'll have fun with the intuitive controls and open gameplay.<br><br>The only criticism is the price, which is still quite high after all these years. <br>That's where I'd like to thank the kind donor and reader Worlddestroyer. Thank you very much!<br>Fans of strange construction games will definitely enjoy here! <br><br>👀<a class="bb_link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/curator/32170554/" target="_blank" rel="">Daredevil Reviews</a> on my curator page.<br><br>👑 Powered by HoI 4 Deu Curators group in German / English 👑 <ul class="bb_ul"><li><br><a class="bb_link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/curator/30388691/" target="_blank" rel=""> Follow Main group </a></li><li><br><a class="bb_link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/curator/40282064/" target="_blank" rel=""> Follow Second group </a></li></ul>			</div>

																I'm at a conflict... I can't recommend it for the price. But I got it for free and I do love the game.<br><br>It feels bare, but the charm comes from the simplicity of it all. And it's easy to look up uploaded solutions and works in progress to draw creativity from others.<br><br>It really is fun, but I can see how others might get bored if you try to play it for a long period of time.<br><br>I wish there more options than yes or no, but I'll vote it thumbs up since I really think the game is fun. Get it at a discount though!			</div>

																Totally addictive. I have just completed every level, it took me 21 hours. Caroonish styling is appropriate and it really transports you to a world where green shapes float mid air. They should teach this in schools, we'd have a lot more (and better) engineers. Some levels are quite challenging. But not enough to make you give up. Side note: I like the "magic hat" as a saving/sharing feature.			</div>

																<b><i>Fantastic Conraption</i> is an excellent VR game to satisfy your inner engineer.</b> If you don't like to solve mechanical puzzles, I'd stay away, but if you do - this is near perfect. This title manages to have a shallow learning curve by not having too many variables. The end goal of each puzzle is simple - get the ballon-like object to the goal. The tools you have at your disposal are also fairly limited and simple - which is great. There are multiple ways to solve each puzzle, which is the cornerstone of any great puzzler.<br><br><b>Pros:</b><br>+I don't know of any other engineer/puzzling game for VR right now - and this one does it well<br>+Great bubbly atmosphere<br>+Not overly complicated in terms of learning curve<br><br><b>♥♥♥♥:</b><br>-Other than it is strictly for those that enjoy 'mechanical puzzles', I cannot really think of any '♥♥♥♥'<br><br><b>If this looks like your kinda thang, I am certain that it is.</b>			</div>

																Game feels broken. There is no menu's despite the manual saying to put on a hat? There is no hat? Buttons don't do anything except grab and stop/play. . It feels like something is off or not working. I have an oculus rift which is stated as compatible.. but I can't access options, settings, level select so i can skip starting over each time the game starts. A menu did pop up randomly once and it was the most confusing thing. Didn't make any sense., Can't recommend this sadly. Fun creative game from what I played tho.			</div>

																One of the Vive greats.<br>It's great solo and even better with friends taking turns.<br>It's been popular with everyone I've demoed my Vive to, my dad played for well over 2 hours straight on his first time.<br><br>Fantastic Contraption has that wonderful mix of simplicity and depth that can make it fun to go back to even after so many hours and so many levels completed. Even redoing levels has value because there's so many different ways to achieve the same goals.<br><br>17 hours between me and friends before the Vive launched, and many, many more to come!			</div>

																Overall: great bones, repetitive levels. Maybe buy it on sale.<br><br>I really wish there was a "recommend, but" or "almost/kind of recommend" option. Much about this game is awesome (one might say fantastic), but the level designs, at least up to level 10b, were kind of repetitive (more on that in a bit). (I played on an oculus rift)<br><br>The basic premise is that you have to use sticks and wheels to build a widget to get a pink glowy thing into a pink glowy area (maybe more pieces later? I played the first 10 levels so far). Things are attached at joints <br><br>Pros: <br> - You can configure the building area. Your building area has a floor with adjustable height and a size - you could drag it to fill up your room, or (as I did) make it so that you're essentially building on a desk in front of you). This is awesome and works well. I wish you could adjust this on the fly (zoom in/out/rotate the world to get a different angle sort of thing), but that's not really necessary and it is very well done.<br><br>- Basic mechanics are great. You can build things, they act as they should, and can do cool things.<br><br>- The controls are great and mostly intuitive. Sometimes if you have a bunch of things joined together and need to break a specific joint, it can be annoying, but over all they're great.<br><br>- Visually and audibly (aurally?) pleasant and relaxing and immersive. I mentioned I made the playing field into a desk - I did try to rest my elbow on it once and felt stupid. <br><br>- No VR pukiness (for me, at least) - I plan on using it as start when I show off my VR headset from now on. I suspect this is because there is no movement in game that is not also movement in real life. I do tend to turn off comfort effects (ie teleporty movement) in VR games, and get used to it after a while, so take this as you will.<br><br>♥♥♥♥: <br><br>The only ♥♥♥ so far, though it's kind of a big one, is that (again, at least up to level 10b), the obvious solutions were nearly all the same: build a car.<br><br>I don't remember the exact order, but my play experience was something like this: goal straight ahead, so build a car. That's fine, intro level, getting you used to how it works. Oh hey, goal straight ahead but in the air - so build a tall car. Goal ahead and to the side, with a wall so you can't drive into but can drive by it: build a car but now hang ball off one side, balanced by weights on the other. That was kind of cool, actually, but then there's the next level: two balls into two goals, both straight ahead: build two cars. Oh hey, something different: build a tower with a spiny thing that'll knock the ball off a pedestal and into the goal. Next level: build the same car with the ball hanging from the side from the first time, but with one tiny modification,<br><br>It got to the point where for one level the obvious solution was build a medium tall car, but I was tired of if, so I built a short car and a medium tall bridge for it to drive on. But then that was kind of finicky (though it would have worked eventually), so I pushed the bridge aside and made the medium car in hopes that the next level would be interesting. The next level: build a car.<br><br>That's when I stopped and wrote this review. Occasionally the car would push something over. Once the ball couldn't be attached to any objects, so I built a cage, put the ball in the cage - and attached the cage to a car. But so many of the levels were just build a car.<br><br>At some point the game gave me a new piece that would stop joints from rotating, which I used a few times. Maybe it gives more pieces later (I really enjoyed the charged particle canon things you could make in the 2d version, dunno if there's charges later on or not. The fact that I built the same car so many times might be slightly less annoying if you could paste in cars you made before, but if you can I don't know how - you can save contraptions by putting on a helmet (think opening a menu) and then dragging them to a shelf. But if you drag from the shelf to a new level, it opens the old level rather than inserting your contraption into the current level.<br><br>Again, many things about this game are awesome, and I intend to use it as a light intro to VR because of the general pleasantness, lack of pukiness, and interactability. But after building slightly different cars for something like 80% of the first 10+ levels within an hour, I had to turn it off. I'll probably fire it back up in a couple days or a week in the hopes of finding different levels, or maybe I'll just impose a personal no car rule and see how far I can get. There's potential there. <br><br>Game has great bones. But the levels...			</div>

																This game is okay, its not a bad game but not a great one either. At first it feels awesome to be building stuff in virtual reality, but you'll quickly get bored because there is only 3 different parts to build with (a wheel, a stick, and a water-stick that parts can go through). If you got it for free with your Vive its worth downloading and trying, but I don't think it worth buying for the full price of $44 (Canadian).			</div>

																So far so good! I enjoyed the flash game years ago, and I'm enjoying this game too! So far I haven't made any complicated contraptions yet, like walkers etc, but it should still be possible. <br><br>Controls are great except for one thing, and that is pulling pieces apart. Sometimes I screw up my entire contraption when I attempt to do that because it tries to readjust half of it incorrectly. I know what not to do but it's intuitive to do it the wrong way so it takes some getting used to. But other than that, it's great so far, very enjoyable.			</div>

																Similar to 'Bad Piggies' on IOS in principle, but in VR. I thought it'd be a hoot, but I'm just glad that game came for free with my headset. The gameplay is frustrating - you're supposed to assemble contraptions from a (very) limited set of objects (stick, balloon, wheel) and hit a target located approximately 10 yards away. <br><br>9 times out of 10 your vehicle fails not because you didn't build it correctly, but because VR counter-intuitively makes it hard to assemble the thing. It fails because a wheel is 5 degree misaligned, and the whole thing falls apart. You'd thing there would be some hilarious moments in there because of the wonkyness of it all, but unfortunately not because the designs possible are so basic. <br><br>PS: disregard time spent in game, I had trouble with my steam account at the time.			</div>

																Fantastic Contraption headed in the right direction. Puzzle solving and object manipulation are two things that the HTC Vive is exceptional at. Fantastic Contraption takes advantage of this in a largely unfulfilled way. You can build contraptions, but are only provided a very limited number of tools. You have challenges to overcome, but they are small in scope.<br><br>The best thing that can be said about Fantastic Contraption is it has a great visual aesthetic and sounds great. Even then, the variety is low.<br><br>Ultimately, Fantastic Contraption is just another low replay value tech demo for the HTC Vive, one that is thankfully included for free, but priced unfairly for anyone who ends up without the free launch games.			</div>

																A wonderful game to put your imagination to good use! <br>The goal of the game is to throw particular items into the black hole, but you have to create a tool to carry the item to the goal by yourself. The initial level gives you a Tutorial about how to make a small car with sticks, wheels and the target ball. Follow the instruction to put the materials in the right place. You can also change the size of the materials to fit your own design, stages went harder and harder, and that is the time for you to imagine freely!<br>Meanwhile, the developers thought about the balance problem. Every parts have its own weight, the assembled parts lose balance when one side is heavier than another. So elaborate isn’t it?<br>A highly free game in general, all parts can be connected with others, you can create whatever you what.<br><br>To talk, play and share your ideas about virtual reality, please join us: <a class="bb_link" href="http://steamcommunity.com/groups/viriver" target="_blank" rel="">http://steamcommunity.com/groups/viriver</a>			</div>

																I wanted to like this game, but it's so boring.<br><br>From what I've been able to establish, you only have 3 different tools to work with. A wheel and two struts.<br><br>The most frustrating thing is you start off trying to do it in a clever way, but end up creating some monstrosity that solves the puzzle by fluke.<br><br>We had a group over, playing all sorts of vr games. All laughing and having fun. Then we played this game. 3 people yawning, watching a bored person take ages to build a failure.<br><br>In the end, we were more relieved to have solved each one rather than pleased with ourselves.<br><br>If it wasn't free I'd be very disappointed indeed. Instead, I just won't play it.			</div>

																Fantastic Contraption is awesome, and definitely my favorite Vive launch title. The puzzles are fun and clever and the world is extremely immersive. Everything is very accessible and the difficulty of the puzzles ramps up slowly and predictably. The recent patches have made the game even better, with the ability to pass levels in different ways to earn various bonuses.<br><br>One thing about the game is that, other than a very short and simple tutorial, the game doesn't hand hold you. There is a lot going on here that is not immediately evident (such as the ability to pull parts off your back or out of your ears). I highly recommend doing a handful of levels, then looking for tips and tricks through the gaming community. Once you uncover some of the hidden stuff in the game, it makes building much faster, and makes getting the different level designations that much more fun.			</div>

																I've only played for an hour, but I already love this game. I laughed out loud with joy almost every time my contraption made it to the goal.<br><br>Being able to change the scale feels amazing. You can look down on a contraption you built on the "table" in front of you, then jump into room scale and gape up in awe as it towers overhead. (Sort of like in Beetlejuice!) The physics make you feel the weight of it all. I dodged instinctually as one of my more precarious contraptions fell over in my direction.<br><br>Finding your way around in this game feels like another game. There's no UI in the headset. Navigating the features requires creativity and discovery. It may sound tedious the way I've described it, but I'm telling you it's absolutely delightful and one of my favorite things about the game.<br><br>Something I wish I had known going into this: The settings menu is on your computer screen, not in the headset (at least using Oculus Link). You configure the scale and position of the play space during the tutorial. I accidentally set the button to finish a puzzle inside my real-world computer desk and felt stuck when I couldn't reach it. I restarted the game several times until I figured out that I could reset it by taking off my headset and looking at the app on my computer.<br><br>This game deserves more reviews and better reviews. It's my favorite VR game right now.			</div>

																Get this game during a sale! It was one of the original Vive launch titles and does so much right for VR puzzle games. However, its starting to show its age and I can't really recommend it for full price. Still a wonderful experience, however.			</div>

																Au début dubitatif sur l\'intérêt du jeu, je l\'ai pris pour faire plaisir à ma femme. Finalement après quelques minutes de jeu j\'ai vraiment été séduit, les graphismes sont sympa, le jeu en lui même est facile à appréhender mais demande de la concentration et de la logique. Cela fait penser à portal en terme de réflexion (en moins poussé quand même), du coup si vous voulez vous amusez avec un jeu non violent qui détend et qui demande un peu d\'adresse et de réflexion ce jeu est fait pour vous.			</div>

																On se prend trés vite au jeu! C'est facile d'accés, le gameplay de construction du "véhicule" tout en gérant la physique des obstacles à franchir est vraiment prenante. La liberté de construction est total, j'ai l'impréssion d'être un enfant de 6 ans qui découvre les Lego(s). Agréable surprise pour ma part.			</div>

																I know building things sounds like a chore but you should probably use your brain for something other than murder for once. Alright - you can build things that seem alive and shatter them if you really want to. Also there's a ball that's disintegrated by lightning at the end of every level, you'll probably enjoy that.			</div>

																Pure awesome and a TON of fun in VR! Great party game, fantastic feeling of immersion, and great graphical style. All kinds of cool touches make up the UI in a way never before seen. Put on a helmet to open the menu. spin a table with a slap of the hand. This is one great game if you have VR! I can't imagine playing it without, and any reviewer who complains about it and doesn't have VR should be ignored. I don't even know why the game would offer non-VR play. Like Hoverjunkers it should be VR only.<br><br>On the downside, it has been feature complete for months, and yet it still launches with all kinds of annoying bugs. Make a contraption too complex and the game barfs, gets a horrid framerate, and the physics go insane. Accidentally place a contraption into the ground before running it, and watch as it bursts apart and now must be painstakingly reassembled. Sticks spin when they shouldn't. Why did the developer not iron these things out in the months they sat around waiting for the Vive to release? It's so polished otherwise, it really is dissappointing to see the bugs in an otherwise perfect title. My guess is they started working on their next game, but they should have finished this one first.<br><br>Overall though, the bugs do not ruin what is otherwise an amazing experience in VR, one of the best I've ever had. It is so fun HOURS will melt away as you play it!			</div>

																Thought it would be dumb, but it's actually really fun.<br><br>The "silly" paint they coat this game with turned me off at first, but it's one of the more engaging experiences. There are only a few items to work with, so I can see "getting a feel for it" quickly, but then making crazier and crazier contraptions to pull it off. The Vive is MADE for this kind of stuff, it's a winner*.<br><br>*edit: fixed :)			</div>

																This game is fantastic. This is the first game I started after Job Simulator. I expected to only play for a few minutes so I could try out all the other great games I purchased and I ended up playing it for well over an hour. This game suprisingly gave me the most sense of presense other than Budget Cuts so far. It felt like I was building a giant model. I would definitely reccomend this for anyone who did not get it bundled with the Vive. Smooth gameplay, no nausea, intuitive control and the unique level designs keep everything interesting.			</div>

																Challening, fun, quirky and colorful. It's great if you like puzzle solving and building things, but I can't really recommend at this price point of $30. If they dropped the price to $10-20 and you want something that everyone can enjoy go for it. I'll still have to recommend the game overall.			</div>

												4/10<br>This game is infuriating. I want to love it and have to advise people to stay away. The controls just don't make an ounce of sense. <br>1) I couldn't do something, checked online and found a bunch of stuff "hidden" that you could use. What?!!??!<br>2) I have frustratingly zoomed out. Couldn't find a way to zoom back in again. Pressed all of the buttons. Nothing worked. Restarted the game and found that I am still zoomed out. It looks like I will have to continue playing a mile away from where I should be! ***What?!?!?!?!<br><br>I can't recommend this. The developers have come up with a great idea, but haven't paid the slightest attention to the basics of game development, and as such, this is unplayable. <br><br>What a shame!			</div>

																Ok, this game sucks your energy and brain.  You start out in a very cartoon looking island and have a basic starting point for where to go.  The tutorials are just right, giving you enough information to learn the game without being overbearing.  There is a lot left to discover on your own which makes it fun.  <br><br>Pros:<br><br>The graphics style of the game perfectly fits what you are trying to do.  You are making very crazy machines that would only fit in a cartoon universe.<br><br>The humor is subtle but well done.  For example there is a helmet you must put on to switch between levels.  You don't realize it till you look at it but the helmet makes you look like you are wearing a tiara.  <br><br>The cat.  Just about the goofiest thing I have ever seen in VR so far.  He's funny and creepy all at the same moment.<br><br>♥♥♥♥:<br><br>It's a bit hard to maniuplate the platform that lets you load other players contraptions.  I kept spinning it too far half the time.<br><br>No open world sandbox that I have found so far.  This game is prime for having a flat earth open sandbox level much like the flat earth creative mode of Minecraft.<br><br>No way to fly or elevate yourself above really tall contraptions so that you can tweak the tops of them without having to pick them up and rotate them.<br><br><br>Overall: 8/10 would pull my own eye out and swap it for the eye on my cat again.			</div>

																Very cool incarnation of the machine building genre. Being able to physically move parts around and assembling stuff in 3D space is something you have to experience for yourself to believe. I highly recommend this as one of the first VR experiences that you use to introduce people to the room-scale VR experience.			</div>

																Spent a couple of hours doing the easy way to complete the level. Spent most of the rest building catapults for every occasion. For an achivement, I tried to build a working chain out of a winch and bits of wood. This all happened in a room.			</div>

																I can't stop playing this game! :o Building contraptions is super addicting and fun. I love sharing my solutions with my friends and seeing all of the creative ideas they come up with to solve problems. I especially love the feature that lets you look at contraptions online, some of the stuff that people build are either genius and terrible ideas that just happened to work, haha!<br><br>If you have VR, don't miss this awesome game!!			</div>

																EDITING my review because it looks like there's been some changes since I last played this. You can resize the play area, which was my biggest gripe. My contraptions were too big for my play area. <br><br>This game is casual fun, game design is hilarious, it's innovative and a great introduction to VR. I can't believe more people aren't playing this.			</div>

																(Note: got this for free with my Vive)<br><br>I dumbfounds me how this is one of the few 'complete' VR games we have right now, yet it is one that works so poorly in VR by nature of the subject itself.<br><br>Engineers and craftsmen rarely do non-artistic things 'by eye (or feel)' and for good reason. Even simple measurment/alignment tools like rulers and straight edges make constructing devices so much less frustrating; and that's the real heart of why this game plays horrible - you have no tools. All you can do is grab things and move them, and god is it frustrating. To rattle off a couple of the most infurating things from my short playtime:<br><br>- There's no way to mirror things. <br>- There's no way to align things. Wheels especially are a MAJOR problem.<br>- There's no way to copy groups of peices and re-use them meaningfully.<br>- There's no way to remove a single peice without stretching the rest of your machine out of whack.<br><br>All of these things is so easy to acomplish with mouse and keyboard controls - for a great example look no further than beseiged. I don't envy Fantastic Contraptions's developers for having to deal with this problem, but that doesn't make the problem go away. Some of the issues I've outlined could likely be addressed, but I think fundamentally constructing multi-jointed machines in this fashion just really sucks to do with your hands, especially when you can't feel them.<br><br>If doing simple mechanical puzzels is your thing, and you *don't* mind spending 90% of your time making minor corrections to wheel alignment, maybe this game is for you. Frankly, I can't be bothered.			</div>

Incredibly limited, the physics can be very unpredictable, and everything has the same texture which hurts my brain after a while.<br><br>Fine to mess around with for a few minutes, but certainly not worth $40			</div>

																The game itself isn't that bad. It does lack a certain amount of replayability but going through it the first time is pretty fun. However, unless you have a large play area it's quite hard to play. I have about 2.4m x 2.4m and because the objects are so big in the game, it often seems hard to build anything, for fear I'm going to put a hole through my wall. I did get this as a free game with my Vive, but if I had paid for this I would be asking for a refund.			</div>

																This is a little puzzle game. You get a few pieces that you can modify to build vehicles, conveyor belts, etc. It's fun, but the fun has its limits. There are 50 puzzles to solve. You can save your contraptions. For an early game, it offers a lot compared to most things on steam.<br><br>The UI is odd. For example, who knew you had to throw old saved contraptions into a volcano to delete them? Common actions are simply not intuitive with the UI. Although it's cute when you figure it out, it seems as if the developers are trying to focus on the physical action of doing things, rather than being intuitive.<br><br>There is much room for improvement. The simplest would be to hook in multiple players, add more parts to play with, and add the ability to create courses for other people to solve.<br><br>Being the most expensive VR game on the Steam Store, there is no question that this is the most overpriced game. For the listed price, I expect more - especially when you compare playtime against other VR games in the store. Most people purchasing the HTC Vive this early will get this game included with the "Vive Bundle Pack" promo as an incentive to buy the headset. <br><br>If the price drops to about a third of its originally listed price, then I would recomend it.			</div>

																This is a nice mini-game that is a nice addition to my VR collection.  Some aspects of this game are very good and somewhat unique to this title.  The developer seems to deliver the intended experience and does a good job of explaining how the game works.<br><br>Like most Vive compatible games, however, the replayability of this game is very low.  Its good for about an hour if I am playing alone or a few hours when playing with friends.<br><br>I think the developer should continue to focus on making interactions take less time.  Building contraptions of any complexity takes a long time and it starts to feel extremely cumbersome.			</div>

																i do not recommend this game. not because it's a bad game (it's not) but because of the bad price: it's WAY too expensive. $40 for a simple puzzle game with 6 levels? are you kidding me? the game itself is a good game, but the price is much too high for the content it delivers. i would say this game should be worth $10 at most.			</div>

																I'm still in the early levels of this game but so far it seems very very well polished and a heck of a lot of fun for puzzle enthusiasts!!<br><br>A must have for puzzle lovers and players new to VR.<br><br>I do, however, get confused in their 'menus' which seem very unintuitive and... well.. confusing.<br><br>You have to spin platforms and pick up objects to change levels and stuff like that.. and one time I ended up in a level editor for a custom map created by someone else and I had to foce quit the game because I couldn't find my way out!!<br><br>Still, a lot of fun.			</div>

																I am glad it was free as otherwise I would have asked for a refund. I was initially excited to play it since I had played the 2D version some years back. Like others have said, at first it felt ok and I even got my son to play it a little, but we both got frustrated soon enough. The game is too repetitious and the interface is quite the worst I have ever experienced. Considering the PHD presenter at the last GDC did a great job presenting the game and the issues, and considering that the game was an important factor in getting the Vive, I am left disappointed.<br>Too bad.			</div>

																There are games that claim to be "made from the ground up for VR" but turn out to use VR as a gimmick. They essentially do not benefit from being in VR, and often are worse off for being in VR. <br><br>Fantastic Contraption was made for VR. Nay, VR was made for Fantastic Contraption. This game would not work if it was not in VR. Period. It is so much fun to build the machines to solve the puzzles, as you are moving around in this new world. The puzzles are diverse and satisfying to solve. The art style is fun and adds to the feel of the game. The mechanics are easy to learn, and the gameplay is amazing. <br><br>I give Fantastic Contraption a 10/10.			</div>

																Loved it! I originally played this game on desktop as a kid and loved the challenges and style of puzzle. It really pushes your creativity and undestanding of physics. It was more difficult creating large contraptions in a 3d space, but it felt so much more rewarding as well. You actually see and  feel immersed in the puzzles you are trying to solve. This is a physics based puzzle game. It was a little difficult getting a hang of the controls at first, but pretty intuitive.			</div>

																I got this game free with the Vive and I can't quite recommend buying it at full price. That being said, it is one of the more polished VR experiences I've seen. Enjoyable overall experience and great visuals. But there isn't very much replay value and it can be a bit boring after a while. 7/10			</div>

																This is hands down the best game out for the Vive. The puzzles are interesting, engaging, difficult, and really get you thinking. At one point I had a room full of friends all trying to figure out what kind of machine to build to solve the harder puzzles - and it was an absolute blast. You make full use of your room space and you get to make really clever contraptions to do hilarious things. I love this game!			</div>

																I am shocked at how terribly designed this game is.  I was working on one of the earliest levels, and somehow something went very wrong, and some of my pieces became incredibly long and shot up into the sky.  I could not see a way to reset them to normal size.  All I wanted to do was restart that level, but the designers apparently did not input a way to do that.  They didn't even include a menu in the game AT ALL.  Pressing the menu button on the Vive controller did nothing.  It boggles my mind how game developers can miss such basic functionality like this.  My advice... AVOID THIS GAME.			</div>

																OPen game, I am in a room, with no menu's, no tutorial, no way to know what to do. Needed to go to youtube to find out how to play. That is extremtly poor design! Not to mention, I have no objectives or anything like in the videos I see :/ I don't even have that purple ball thing all the objectives need, so this game was a total waste... good thing it was free, though I should be getting paid for wasted time :)			</div>

																A really REALLY fun game, particularly with other people around. The puzzles ramp up nicely and start to get challenging!<br><br>I wish there were more components. Kinda like where Besiege is going. I admit there's a fun in building complex things from simple elements but the addition of triggers and elastic links would make it a whole lot better in my opinion			</div>

																Don\'t like it. VR part and tech done right and actually very polished.<br><br>But theme and atmosphere is just not for me.<br><br>Also construction is not so interesting. It\'s like casial version of Besiger that lacks of good blocks for building machines. Variation is also limited.<br><br>Still one of the first VR games, very polished technically and great VR design.<br><br>Would be happy to see more serious games from this developer. Quality is very polished.			</div>

																This game came as part of the Vive's bundle of games.  I probably wouldn't have bought it otherwise.  It's kinda neat, but the whole 'contraption' thing seems overblown.  Maybe in later levels it gives you more to work with, but all I saw was 1) a fred flinstone style tire, a very fred flinstone style beam/strut/support and a red ball... Oh and some balloon-like things that I have no idea how to use properly other than decoration.<br><br>There's a farting cat that carries your tools, and a "dog" that shows up so you can punch its nose and change levels.  I didn't put that much time into it because it really wasn't that much fun.  Maybe I'll try again and maybe more options will open up and the game will get fun, but I haven't got the patience for it now.			</div>

																I love this game!<br><br>What a great way to wind down after work, by settling yourself into a cute world of bright colours and a cat! Except for that creepy cloud in the corner, which my gaze is drawn to every once in a while causing a chill to run down my spine.<br><br>Anyway, the interactivity with this game is amazing. I don't really play it very long in a single sitting, but I find myself repeating levels to see what kind of Fantastic Contraptions I can come up with to achieve a simple goal. It really feels like I'm standing on a floating block of grass, and I can really lose myself in this world where deadlines, projects and bosses do not exist.<br><br>10/10			</div>

																Got the game for free when buying my vive. Played it a couple of hours and was impressed of the game when I was new to VR.<br><br>Haven't played it for some months now and I can't feel the need either.<br><br>This has some really original gameplay, why is that??? What's the problem???<br><br>I can tell you, it's a really really boring gameplay. Build a car and just being able to watch it.. not my kind of game, and my children wasn't that impressed either.<br>			</div>

																This game is a disaster. I only tried it because it came free with the Vive. My main point of criticism is impreciseness. Really, try to do things twice the same way and see the results. They will differ, and in do so in critical ways. This is so annoying that I gave up after half an hour.			</div>

																This, by far, is one of the most awesome experiences you can have in VR. Something that actually makes use of VR's potential in gaming! It's simple, yet challenging and a ton of fun alone or with friends! A few have complained about the price tag, VR games can have high prices but it's mostly because not many people are doing it yet. Plus a lot of people got this game for free in Vive bundles very early into the game's life. I think at this point that the price is just about right for what you get in this cute puzzle VR game. All the extras like supporting twitch chat, recording options/angles and the mixed reality support out of the box are also a fantastic bonus! I did a video of some gameplay in MIXED REALITY here:<br><br><div class="dynamiclink_box " onclick="DynamicLink_PlayYouTubeVideoInline( this, &quot;NZ-GA6QzCHg&quot; );">

																普段考えないことを考えさせられます。<br>閃いたアイデアが成功すると嬉しいですね。<br><br>他のVR専用ゲームがそうなのですが、基本的な操作が何をして良いのかわかりにくいものが多いです。<br>本ゲームも終了の仕方がわかりません。<br>　システムボタンを押して強制終了させています。<br>さらにSave/Loadもわかりにくいです。<br>　ヘルメットを被ってスタートルーム？に移動する。<br>　机？が2つあって、さらに右側に見えているマップのようなものがロードといいうかセレクトテーブルの模様。<br>　左の机から遊びたい面？を掴んでセレクトテーブルに置く。<br>　ヘルメットを脱ぐとセレクトテーブルに置いた面になっている。<br><br>　机は回転します。机の手前下レバーを上から下に押すと次のステージ。下から上に押すと前のステージが出てきます。			</div>

																This game with my first VR headset and I probably played it for a triple digit number of seconds. I mean, I just can't do all that figurin' when I'm supposed to be having fun, with a computer strapped to my face no less. Clearly, its of High Qualitie, but it's something you can and should just play on your phone. <span class="bb_spoiler"><span>Now I wonder what game I would subsititue in the OG Vive Bundle. Hmmm. I guess The Blu, or whatever. There wuddn't much to choose form back then. Starseed 1 is the best choice I think.</span></span>			</div>

																If you use Windows Mixed Reality, be cautious in buying this! Be sure to test it out within 14 days.  I could not get this game to work with my Windows Mixed Reality controllers at all. The controllers annoyingly buzzed all the time, the space didn't scale properly and things moved AWAY when I tried to pick them up or touch them. The controllers jumped around in the space and nothing worked right. Exiting the game my controllers still were messed up. Unfortunately I spent 20 days working on it and didn't realize refunds must be within 14 days, so I am stuck with a broken game. Maybe someday it will be updated to fix this issue, but I don't believe I am the only one.			</div>

																This is an incredibly creative VR puzzler.  I was blown away how the entire game doesn't use a single menu- all of the settings and navigation are handled through a "hat" you where that puts you into a "settings screen room"  This game feels like what VR will be 10 years from now and it's somehow already 3 years old!			</div>

																A fun puzzle game with a unique design. It relies on your imagination and ingenuity to solve challenges. The challenges get a hard, but involves essentially the same few components throughout. I wish there was a bit more variety, but a great independent title that deserves more attention IMHO.			</div>

																Building is too luck based. Most of the time is spent on minor adjustments that can change direction of your contraption dramatically. It doesn't matter what you build, as long as you move a thing an inch and launch it again, move a thing an inch and launch it again.......<br><br>- Not enough different parts. Building supports for bigger contraptions is a pain. Compared to any other builder this somehow seems random as minor angle differences effect everything so drastically and there's no snapping of parts to make anything straight.<br><br>+ Good idea. Probably best VR builder game (currently, not that much competition).			</div>

																Hat schon ordentlich Spass gemacht mit Freundin oder Freuden im Wohnzimmer gemeinsam abwechselnd zu spielen. Am besten man hat dazu ordenltich Platz und einen grossen Fernseher oder Beamer auf dem Leute zusehen können.<br><br>Es ist vielleicht nicht perfekt in jeglicher Hinsicht, manche Spielmechaniken könnten besser umgesetzt sein aber es läuft gut und im Grunde sehr fehlerfrei und ist ein entspannendes, kleineres aber dank Workshop-Integration beliebig erweiterbares, Physiv-Puzzle Spiel, dem ein Preis von 10-15€ vielleicht besser passen würde... nachdem ich es aber umsonst im Bundle anfangs dabei hatte bin ich damit schon sehr zufrieden. ;D Wenn es in Aktion ist, und man keinen unbegründeten unaussprechlich tiefen Hass gegen Katzen empfindet, dann sollte man hier unbedingt zugreifen.			</div>

																Games like this exemplify why Steam's binary "yes/no" system is insufficient. Fantastic Contraption VR is juuuuuust barely on the no side of the fence.<br><br>On one hand, I think Fantastic Contraption VR has a lot of potential, and is, in theory, a really cool game.<br><br>On the other, there are just so many failures in execution that it is only a hollow shell of what it could be.<br><br>The biggest problem is simply a lack of tools. You're able to grab parts, move parts, join parts, and delete parts. That's pretty much it. While it's true that you can (in theory) build anything allowable within the confines of the game rules with just these functions, the problem is that, when you can only add one part at a time, contraptions that consists of hundreds of parts take painfully long to build, and contraptions that require any sort of precision are nearly impossible.<br><br>If this game had a few more of the following features, I would recommend it in a heartbeat.<br>-Allow selecting all parts in an area and moving them while leaving the rest of the parts attached to them alone. (Basically, a middle ground between moving a single part and moving everything with the grip)<br>-Implement <i>some</i> way of aligning parts. For example: Allow snapping parts to a grid. Or, add a function that duplicates a part and places the copy parallel to the original. (Or both!)<br>-Implement a way to duplicate a selected group of parts.<br>-Implement a way to save a selected group of parts as a sub-assembly, and a way to grab copies of that sub-assembly at any time and in any level.			</div>

																Fantastic Contraptions challenges users to build car-like contraptions that will deliver a ball to a certain target. Players can work together to design the contraption, revise and retry their ideas.  Communication is critical and involves technical language that often incorporates math and science vocabulary.  Players must apply math, science, and engineering skills to build the contraptions.  The game has various levels, so it is easy to move students in and out of the game or to stop and restart the game at a later point.  Early levels can easily be completed under thirty minutes.  Mass celebrations usually occur when the target is hit.  Used with middle school students.			</div>

																Part physics simulation, part puzzle game, part virtual Meccano set with unlimited parts.<br><br>This is VR done right. The UI is absolutely brilliant. Fluid, intuitive, fun to use. Developers scrapped all the concepts from 2D interfaces and reinvented user interactions specifically for 3D space and VR controllers. Designers should study this game in college. It's the closest thing to "programming" with manipulable objects I've seen outside of academic projects.			</div>

																For 20 dollarydoos you cant really go wrong here. It does not have as many parts as I would like, but there is a batch of content here, especially with the 2.0 update. You can build some pretty crazy stuff, even though almost everything you will make to clear levels will be some form of roller/spinner. That doesnt really matter though, as the experience of solving the puzzles in VR within your playspace is well worth the price of admission. Its also a pretty cool game for demoing the Vive to people, as its an early Vive title.			</div>

																Build stuff in VR to move a little ball to a goal area.  Really cool artistic style and some innovative features, for example you access alot of menu type functions in game by placing a helmet on your head in VR which then changes your view.			</div>

																Dit spel is leuk, de leercurve is prima en er zijn onwijs veel levels om te spelen. Daarnaast zijn er ook heel veel Steam Workshop levels. De makers hebben veel support voor de game en dat maakt het totaalplaatje af. Als je de optie hebt kan je dit spel ook met een externe camera voor mixed reality configureren.			</div>

																Played with Vive, Game works really well and puzzles are a lot of fun. The kids love playing (but haven't had much time in there yet). I think this will get a lot more play time in the future - just too much else to try at the moment.			</div>

																A really fantastic puzzle game. If you like legos, tinkertoys, or just building in general, then Fantastic Contraption is the perfect VR game for the job. The game environment is full of surprises, and is really quite stunning to look at. I can think of no way that this experience could be improved. I have not yet tried the level editor, but I expect great things from it!			</div>

																Simple to pickup, hard to master. This game requires equal parts logic and luck, the more components your contraption has, the more chaotic and random its behaviour becomes. It's funny and frustrating at the same time, but always brings a smile when the stupid ball eventully goes home. <br><br>Son of a b*itch ball, why didn't you just go home? That's your home!! ARE YOU TO GOOD FOR YOUR HOME?? <br><br>:D<br><br>			</div>

																Well friends, let me start by saying I got this free with my Vive.  Regardless, it's still a really great game. The challenges are varied and fun for the most part. It's incredibly intuitive to maneuver the pieces in any position. <br>One of the best ideas in the game is the inventory system. Need a stick? Reach over your shoulder. Looking for glue? Reach in your ear. <br>Using the helmet as the main menu is absolutely brilliant. <br>The most complaints I've heard about this game is the price. Hopefully the devs move in that direction, but overall this game really impressed me. I've played well over 30 Vive and oculus games and I still got a kick out of this one.			</div>

																It's not the longest game in the world, but it's very unique, well-made, and might be fun to play with friends.  The current price at the time I'm writing this is $40, which I think is a little high.  I got it for free with the Vive as part of a launch promotion.  If I had bought it instead, I probably would have waited for it to go on sale.  If you see it on sale for $15 or less, I'd recommend trying it out.			</div>

																This game is great and all, but I really really wish there was an option to snap pieces to a grid. It's difficult to get some angles level when you have a small play space. Some will say you just have to move what you are working on, but often I get a rubberband effect when I do that and it messes up my whole project. That hasn't stopped me from having fun with it 98% of the time, however.<br><br>(Note: Product came with purchase of Vive)			</div>

																Amazing physics puzzle. So very simple, you have 3 basic items to build : engine+wood stick+air stick. Now you have a target and a ball to put on that target. <br><br>Easy enough? Well add walls, add curves, add crevasses, add tons of balls,... that's it, an overwhelming exciting amount of puzzles in front of you. Go, make, fail, try, fail, try and... so much fun!			</div>

																It is definitely a must-have in a VR library ! Works for everyone, from early beginner in VR, to hardcore VR addict :)<br><br>This game is the one I first advise for those interested in innovative interactions. Somehow the developers here managed to design unique interactions, something you won't found in other VR games. The concepts here are very interesting from the designer/developer point of view. And it's really fun to mess with the cat !			</div>

																So far I've only had time to play a little bit in this game but what I have played has been very entertaining! The ability to create random designs to accomplish the goals allows for some interesting differences in how different family members tackle problems! As much fun to watch what others do as to do it yourself. I just wish there was more variety to the objects you can use early on.			</div>

																In this game you basically build carts over and over again. Your only building materials are wheels and rods, so you're pretty limited in what you do. The $39.99 price tag is ridiculous, I wouldn't pay a dollar for it. It's obviously priced to increase the perceived value of the vive headset since it comes free with it			</div>

																an absolute showcase for room-scale VR with the Vive.  Endlessly fun, I'll be coming back again and again to this one.  It's like having an endless pile of digital legos or Erektor set, and some truly interesting challenges to frame it all up.<br><br>Also this has some of the most delightful UI choices I've seen yet on the Vive.  The space helmet is amazing.			</div>

																Hey look, buddy. I'm a virtual engineer. And that means I solve puzzles. Not puzzles like "what is reality" because that would fall within the purview of your conundrums of philosophy. I solve fantastic puzzles. For instance: "How am I gonna get some little pink balloon over a structurally formidable green obstacle?" The answer? Build a contraption. And if that don't work? Build more contraptions. Like this cradle-shaped 8-wheel caterpillar tank designed by me. Built by me. And you'd best hope... not modded by you.			</div>

																Strange so many negative reviews.  I had my doubts about this game, but it turned out to be the most fun out of several VR games I've tried.  It may not have tons of features, but what it does have is a blast to play.			</div>

																If it didn't come with the vive I wouldn't have bought it, and I can't begin to imagine how they justify the 39.99 price.  It's cutesy and mildly entertaining for a few minutes, but quickly lost it's appeal.  I've demoed the vive for around 30 people so far and everyone wants to try something else very quickly. <br><br>I can't point to any one thing about it, and I don't hate it by any means. But I would certainly not recommend it at it's current price.			</div>

																This game hardly works, its sad that this was a game the picked to ship out with VR, its a disgrace. in 10 minutes the game has froze, and or controllers became unresponsive twice. The only thing I can do is call the cat to me, other than that, nothing. Sure as HELL isnt worth $40 and I wouldnt even tell people about it for $10.  Been playing VR for 3 weeks and I've never had issues this bad.			</div>

																A fantastic experience as an intro to the Vive (pun intended). I actually found it very difficult at first but getting used to the physics it gets easier, even if the challenges get more difficult. Comes free with the Vive so it's definitely a must play. Not too intensive on the GPU either. Good fun!			</div>

																The game I want to love..  This was free with the Vive, and as far as current offerings go is probably one of the more feature complete experiences.  That said however, I didn't really enjoy it.  The physics work correctly, and the puzzles aren't all easy, but there was just something missing for me.  Perhaps lack of parts?  You really only have a wheel and two types of sticks to build with, so simplicity is it's essence.  I tried it a few times because free, but unfortunately it is now at the bottom of my list of games to play again.			</div>

																You get this game free with HTC Vive pre-order. I would not buy it myself as this is not the kind of game for me. But since I got it free I gave it a try. I was surprised how different experience this can be in VR. I am not good at building things, it kept bending and tripping on me most of the time. In the end I've beaten the tutorial though!<br><br>In each scenario you get a room with obstacles and goal area. And your task is to build a vehicle to bring the ball into the goal area. You only get wheels and pipes. In 2D or 3D this would bore me in a minute. But the VR experience was totally different. If you can grab this as a free gift or cheap, or if you enjoy building cartoon vehicles then give this a try.			</div>

																I loved this flash game, so the moment I saw it came with Vive pre order, I jumped at the opportunity.<br><br>And as luck would have it, I love the crap out of it in VR. It's so relaxing to have a VR game in that isn't things constantly shooting at you. I can go sit on the ground and build a cart out of tree branches to pull a red ball to the goal, or make a catapult that puts said ball into orbit and then hops off the build platform. <br><br>The achievement system is the most adorable thing I think I've seen. After I realized that all of my acheivements were the little dangely charms on my controller hands, I spent the next two days getting all of them. <br><br>My only issue with it is that I feel like there needs to be a way to align the wheels straight or to angles. I spend so much time fiddling around with them so the car doesn't go slightly to the left or slightly to the right and it's annoying.			</div>

																I loved the 2D version and this does not disappoint.  It's mostly a demo of the capabilities of VR and is more limited in the level complexity and build complexity that the original 2D version, but it is an awesome VR experience with the touch controllers.  The Devs nailed the Vive interface and the virtual environment.			</div>

																Would buy if not included in purchase of Vive. <br><br>Seems like one of the true lengthy and robust games on the Vive currently.<br><br>((Side Note: The things you build with can be drummed on like an instrument and emit tones depending on their size! Could see some Mario Paint style musical jams coming out with it. :))<br><br>I don't host friends much but I can imagine this would be a smash with some buds over to hang. As a solo player tho I can only handle a level or two before I have to move on or take a break.<br><br> Same with any VR really tho... Small bites till I gain a stronger tolerance.  ;)<br><br>			</div>

																It’s is an overall simple and intuitive fun game.<br><br>This is a really fun little building game. The premise is simple, get the thing to the other thing. It is a very immersive game because you end up being so focused on how to solve the puzzle. It also has by far the best in game menu I have seen in a VR game yet. <br><br>It does have a few issues though, there are two hidden items, joint glue and unpowered wheels, that really should just be normal items in the game that I did not know about until I was looking though the discussion board. Also if you get really into building super complex machines the game, while running the simulation, will sometime stutter. In VR this is a nauseating experience. However once I found about the hidden items and figured out how to use the water sticks, I was able to build simpler machines to finish each puzzle.<br><br>This is ending up being the first game I show to people when I am showing off my Vive.<br>			</div>

																Weird, addictive, fun. Have enjoyed the little bit of time in there so far, will definitely be going back for more. Very relaxing experience, meditative like playing with legos as a kid. Very polished and fleshed out, definitely makes you think, can leave you feeling like an engineer at times.			</div>

																One of the most immersive and fun experiences I've had a room scale.  There are lots of fun little interactive and responsive elements that just make you want to smile.  The game is very accessible, and should be very easy to drop in to for fans of the Flash version. (Though this one is more challenging!)  People who aren't familiar with the Flash version may wish for a better tutorial (Youtube is your friend).<br><br>I recommend this game completely, and I think it's a good choice for introducing people to the Vive if you're willing to coach them through the gameplay itself.			</div>

																Fantasic game!!!<br><br>Once you understand the controls and how each segment works (no tutorial with brief tips), this game is total fun. Up to 50 stages( according to achievement) have been made for the game with each of them getting harder and harder. <br><br>Fun to watch people for the first time to make a contraption and seeing what they make to finish the level. <br><br>Just wish there were more block segments to mess around with.			</div>

																Great game, much more enjoyable once you figure out how to use the hidden pieces - developer should definitely have revealed them once you reach level 5 or 10.  Also could use a lot of additional in-game detail or tutorial about the color coding system for completing levels.			</div>

																This clever game allows you to build different contraptions with various parts plucked from a cat, or yourself, in order to get a pink ball to touch a pink area on the other side of the map. This game is very fun &amp; contains 50 puzzles! It lets you share your work with the community and build what ever you want from the given parts, but I recommend not playing with the minimum room-scale space, for it can be a tad bit frustrating having to move large contraptions that end up jittering or spazing out in place. Also, not sure why the fox on the Steam image is wearing an Oculus, but oh well!			</div>

																I'm four hours of gameplay into Fantastic Contraption, which came free with my HTC Vive. I'd have paid a hefty price for this great choice of a bundled launch title.  While I've enjoyed construction games in the past, it's a different experience to actually put hands on components in front of you.  The UI is enjoyable and makes clever use of virtual reality.  I have high hopes that the success of this title will lead to bigger and better things for this developer.			</div>

																This is the most complete Vive game I've played. I love it. So much replay value too, and it's a great party/hangout game. I love building things, and doing that in VR is supes trippy. I was a fan of Fantastic Contraption back in the day when it was played on a flat screen, and now it exists as a reality in the virtual dimension. Strange times ahead.			</div>

																There is so much to love about this game, I really like the style and game mechanics. It also shows off how great roomscale and tracked controllers can be in VR. I hope the devs will be able to continue to add to the game, I'm researching contraption designs before really diving into things, ha.			</div>

																I am so glad this was a pack in game with the Vive. I may have overlooked it otherwise. I love these sorts of games where you have to build things to complete objectives. I also love the visuals. I had such  sense of presence the other night that when I got mad at my contraption not working I went to throw it past my room boundaries and I hit the wall with my controller. Nothing broke but 10/10 would do again (as long as nothing breaks). Also some of these levels are hard.			</div>

																Really fun puzzle game where you build contraptions to complete goals. It is incredibly intuitive to control, especially when compared to other games in the genre where often the hardest initial learning curve of the game is getting around the controls and various menus you'd have to work with. This game does away with menus and lets you build things just by working with your hands. <br><br>The downsides are that the game is fairly simplistic with only a few different part types you can make contraptions out of. Also the game could do with putting more limitations on the player, as currently there is no limitation on how large you can make a contraption, allowing you to make solutions to puzzles that feel like you're cheating the system. But despite the game's simplicity the game does offer a decent challenge and inspires creative solutions. <br><br>Out of the entire lineup of VR launch titles this is one of my favourites, and in my opinion the best out of all the free bundled titles that come with the two major headsets.			</div>

																A fun puzzle game that's easy to get into, but a little shallow overall.  Unfortunately tries a little too hard to be goofy, while not quite trying hard enough to enforce rules to make a good challenge.  Could use a little more variety.  Some off-the-wall choices like using a helmet to access the menu system, rather than the dedicated menu buttons, are annoying rather than creative.			</div>

																WIth the ability to move around a full scale contraption, I could not help but smile as I watch my inventions fail.  Why?  Because it is so realistic in terms of the physics that I felt like I was building something real.  This made successful inventions so much more enjoyable.  It is extremely intuitive and you can build contraptions in a snap.  This is a must-have and must-play for the Vive.			</div>

																This game is a really great showcase for VR interaction wrapped up in a fun and challenging puzzle experience. Building things in VR is an awesome use case for the Vive and tracked motion controllers. The art style is really weird but the focus is the building and puzzles so the environment doesn't matter that much. Plus the little cat is cute, I wish my real world cats could carry stuff around and bring it over to me when I needed it.			</div>

																I love this game.<br><br>If you have any love for puzzle games, you will feel the same way and if it weren't bundled with the Vive already, it would be an insta-buy.<br><br>So many people have been knocking the first VR games as tech demos and not having any depth, but I am sure those people have not completed this game.  It's easy to take well over an hour building the perfect contraption for a level and there are something like 50 levels.<br><br>I look forward to many many more hours in this beautiful and fun environment challenging my spatial thinking.			</div>
