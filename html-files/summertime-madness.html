sure, there's a war, but <b>the whole point of your journey is to escape from reality, not to get back to it asap</b>. as I found out, <b>explorer mode without a timer unlocks after finishing the game</b>, which is complete nonsense. don't make me waste hours to rush through everything as fast as I can to finally let me play how I wanted to in the first place.<br><br>you can shave some time off by replaying earlier chapters faster, because we all know that's what story-based games are all about: speedrunning, repetition and optimization during the first (and for many, the only) playthrough. <b>the time limit is pretty generous</b>, 6 hours is more than enough to finish it, 3 might do it as well (it took me a bit less than that with some outside help), but then why have a timer in the first place? and <b>even if you finish with hours to spare, there's only 15 minutes for the final section</b>, making the clock an even more baffling and unnecessary inclusion.<br><br>the second problem is <b>no mid-chapter saving</b>. have to do each section in one go, and all the walking necessary in some of them makes you feel you're wasting too much of already limited time. checkpoints aren't placed at the beginning of new chapters either, so continuing next time you'll have to open a door again, <b>watch the same unskippable cutscenes</b> again, etc. checkpoint-only saving can be done right, but it's not done right here.<br><br>either of these things could result in an instant thumbs down, no matter how absolutely gorgeous the game looks (gameplay and functionality come first, eyecandy not necessarily even second), but both of them combined is just a <b>waste and disrespect of the player's time</b>.<br><br>it's especially sad because the dev is clearly dedicated and the technical aspects (not just the graphics and the audio) are done really well for the most part, and it <b>runs fine on my pretty low-end hardware</b>, but in the process <b>it forgets that it's just a video game to be played according to one's own schedule, not one dictated by the game</b>.<br><br>movement speed is fast enough while sprinting (can be toggled, no need to hold, nor a need to turn it off) and <b>controls do their job but they're not rebindable</b>. you can use a controller, or wasd or arrows for movement, 'e' to interact, mouse to look around, right click to zoom out, tab to bring up the dreaded pocket watch.<br><br>various languages, windowed mode, resolution options, graphics quality, motion blur toggle, and a single volume slider are available from the main menu, complemented by an fov slider, invert x/y camera, and even a paint effect slider while playing. audio is mixed properly, so the only slider is not a huge deal, but toggles for sound, music and speech would still be nice. company logos on startup can't be skipped either, and once new game is clicked, there's no way to go back to the main menu after the intro, have to choose a game mode and start playing first.<br><br>even though I didn't particularly enjoy the ride, if explorer mode was available from the start and manual saving (or more checkpoints) got patched in, I might cautiously recommend it, the price would be reasonable as well. as it is, <b>I can only suggest watching a let's play on youtube, so you can stop and continue without losing progress</b>, though honestly, you're not missing much by not experiencing it. hopefully, their next game is gonna offer more than pretty things to look at in a well-optimized package.			</div>

																Ever dance with the devil in the pale moonlight?   <br><br> <br><br>Take control of an artist who is offered a deal to escape the madness of war and live for 6 hours inside his paintings.  He has to navigate his creations and reach the end before midnight or be trapped forever. <br><br> <br><br><b> FULL DISCLAIMER:  I was provided a free Steam key by the developer ahead of launch but I had already completed this game by receiving it in the May Humble Choice first.  So I won’t be labelling this review as ‘Got this game for free’. </b> <br><br>   <br><br><div class="bb_h1"> THE PROS </div> <br> <br><br><ul class="bb_ul">+  Vincent would be proud.  The low poly look of the game reminds me of The Witness.  The way the wind blows through the grass is beautiful and overall the art design is one of the game’s greatest wins.  Things look real but only quite real enough to be in a painting. If you want to really go all in on the painterly graphics you can use the slider to max it out and really take a stroll through a van Gogh. </ul> <br> <br><br><ul class="bb_ul">+  The hills are alive with the sound of madness.  The music of the game and the accompanying sounds have really been a top priority.  I have always maintained how music and ambient sound can make or break a game experience and here the aural experience works really well. </ul> <br> <br><br><ul class="bb_ul">+  paint me a puzzle.  Overall the puzzles in the game are a dash of everything.  There is some exploration to do, levers to pull and things to rotate.   But there are also some really hard order of operation puzzles and thinking way out of the box to do too.  There is no real theme to the puzzles (like for instance in Portal or The Witness) and its rather like a mashup of a bunch of different types of puzzles. </ul>  <br><br> <br><br><ul class="bb_ul">+ pace.  I don’t think I have ever listed ‘pace’ as a pro or ♥♥♥ before.  Let me explain.  Summertime Madness is a game that might take you 10 or 20 hours to 100% if you try and find all the secrets by yourself.  But it is a game you can quite comfortably complete in about 3 hours or less.  Once you do that it might become a game that you can complete in 1 hour.  Good news is there is a cheevo for that.  There are many ways to delve into madness.  It is up to you.  You can tackle the game at your own pace and then ramp it up as you see fit.  </ul> <br> <br><br><ul class="bb_ul">+  price.  For an indie title of this quality I would have expected to pay a bit more than 10 bucks.  I am a cheap gamer but this is a very fair price. </ul> <br>   <br><br><div class="bb_h1"> THE ♥♥♥♥ </div> <br> <br><br><ul class="bb_ul">-  hint?  What hint?  The hint system is well intentioned but often falls short of utility.  By the time you are ready to take a hint, the hint you are given is usually 3 steps behind what you have already done.  There are some points where the hint works out in your favour but in general they are quite vague and there is only 1 hint per level. </ul> <br> <br><br><div class="bb_h1"> THE CONCLUSION </div> <br> <br><br>I was very surprised to find Summertime Madness as part of Humble Bundle’s DRM free choice for the month.  A whole month before the Steam launch too.  The Steam version definitely has all the usual benefits such as cheevos and the ability to take screenshots though.   <br><br> <br><br>If you like indie puzzle games then Summertime Madness will give you a good few hours of entertainment and you will take some excellent screenshots along the way.   <br><br> <br><br>Pick it up and support your indie devs.   <br><a class="bb_link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdwZZ9b-GEo&amp;" target="_blank" rel=""> Interview with the developer </a><br><a class="bb_link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1CyQpeeWfc&amp;ab_channel=FillingInTheGapsFillingInTheGaps" target="_blank" rel=""> Video Review </a>			</div>

																От стелса перенесемся в мир живописи, где среди зеленых полей и кристально чистых ручьев будет разворачиваться самая настоящая драма человека, который захотел сбежать от суровой действительности.<br><br>В конце Второй Мировой Войны один неизвестный широкой публике пражский художник получает необычное предложение от незнакомца. Этот загадочный мужчина появился ночью прямо посреди небольшой матерской нашего героя. Сейчас, когда мир трещит по швам, а земля залита кровью, творческая душа ищет отдушины. Места, где безмятежная атмосфера поможет художнику стать единым со своей музой и создать общепризнанный шедевр. И вот как раз в ту ночь незнакомец предлагает нашему герою найти убежище в одной из уже написанных им картин. Его взгляд был максимально серьезен, а на лице не читалось улыбки. Пожав друг другу руки, шутки ради, мы выбираем себе картину "Летний остров", но обернувшись мы удивленно замечаем что наша серая узкая каморка на чердаке пропала и вместо этого нашему взгляду открылся прекрасный летний пейзаж. Мы действительно оказались в своей картине, но не без условий. Нам отведен небольшой промежуток времени за который мы сможем отсюда выбраться, в противном случае нам придется остаться здесь навсегда. Так, небольшая забава переросла в жестокое испытание, где наш герой вынужден проявить всю свою логику и смекалку, чтобы вернуться в физический мир.<br><br>Summertime Madness это красивая и эстетически приятная для глаз головоломка. Здесь действительно ощущается лето - июньский свежий ветер, июльское жаркое солнце и теплые августовские ночи. Гулять по здешнему миру было бы довольно медитативным занятием, если бы не геймплейная начинка. Тут у нас действительное есть внутриигровой таймер за который нам необходимо пройти игру. Не стоит пугаться, времени у нас будет предостаточно. Игра спокойно проходится за 2 часа со всеми размышлениями и бэктрекингом, а к этому времени таймер еще не закончится. Ко всему прочему наши впечатления изрядно подпортят многочисленные лабиринты, прохождение которых мы никак не сможем пропустить.<br><br>В итоге все чем мы будем заниматься это искать выход из запутанных коридоров и постоянно перемещаться между разными  частями карты, чтобы выполнить там несколько действий. Как визуальный аттракцион вполне себе приятная для глаз игра, но вот как головоломка Summertime Madness не удалась. Конечно она мне понравилась, но ее бесконечный бэктрекинг и лабиринты с поиском выхода рискуют очень быстро наскучить игроку и превратить яркое приключение в душное и унылое занятие. Берите на свой страх и риск.			</div>

																<a class="bb_link" href="http://store.steampowered.com/curator/32482033/" target="_blank" rel="">Crim's Humble Opinion Curator</a><br><br><div class="bb_h1">Perplexing walking Puzzler</div>Summertime Madness serves a perplexing story of an artist looking to escape the horrors of war by making a deal with the devil to enter one of his paintings. With devil deals, there is of course a catch. The artist has to make it out within a certain time frame or he shall be trapped inside the painting forever. How long the player actually has to accomplish this task is up to the player. By default, you have two choices. Complete the game within 6 hours or to complete the game without a time limit. <br><br>There is some outside the box thinking needed in order to solve the puzzles, however the game is forgiving with checkpoints and the time at least on the six hour difficulty is really there for immersion. I honestly feel like there is plenty of time to figure out the world and puzzles within the time frame regardless of your skill. If you feel weary of timed modes you can always play the explorer mode which offers a stress free play style. <br><br><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2522409436" class="dynamiclink_box modalContentLink  ugc" data-modal-content-sizetofit="true" data-appid="1360550" data-publishedfileid="2522409436">

</a><br><br>The graphics and world is beautiful and surreal. You can tweak the scale of paint in the options making it have more or less of a "in a painted world" effect. From watching the grass blow in the wind, to exploring escher-esque puzzle rooms; there is a lots of treats for the eyes. The music also goes hand in hand with each environment you visit. Areas are disconnected in this world. It's almost as if the devil has visited the painters art piece which is where you start and inserted obstacles that are not really connected to solve for the artist to get out. There's also plenty of secrets to find and harder difficulties with a smaller time frame to finish the game for replayability. <br><br><div class="bb_h1">The Minor Gripes</div>This game is another instance of kind of subjective to the player. Although there is a way to play the game without a time limit now, it feels like it was intended to play with the time limit. I personally really dislike time limits in games especially the idea of it being in an exploration puzzle game, but again I felt the time here was not a major push in the unforgiving direction. You are given 15 minutes to solve the last puzzle regardless of your time, which while somewhat disappointing is also plenty of time to figure it out. <br><br>There is a fair amount of walking around for your puzzles. This to me was no problem whatsoever. There is a run button you can toggle on and off, but if walking sims aren't your thing, than you may not like the amount of "walking" necessary in some puzzles. Aside from that, the only other real gripe I had was to do with story. I'm not really sure what to say because I don't want to spoil what little there is, but I just feel like it could have been more interesting with the premise. <br><br><div class="bb_code"><div class="bb_h1">(っ◔◡◔)っ ♥ pros ♥</div>+Beautiful &amp; surreal painted world

<div class="bb_h1">(っ&gt;▬&lt;)っ x ♥♥♥♥ x</div>-If walking sims aren't your thing, you won't like the amount of walking involved
-Story feels like it could have been more developed

</div><br>While the initial game on the timed difficulty it was intended on will probably get you around 3-4 hours, there is some replayability to go hunting for secrets and tackle the game on harder difficulties. Once you figure out the game it has somewhat of a diminishing return to game effect because you know all the puzzles and your way around. I still found my entire time with this game enjoyable and would recommend it. <br><br><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2522409436" class="dynamiclink_box modalContentLink  ugc" data-modal-content-sizetofit="true" data-appid="1360550" data-publishedfileid="2522409436">

																Пражский художник в конце второй мировой войны получает заманчивое предложение - спастись от ужасов бомбежек внутри одной из своих картин. Единственное условие - выбраться из нее своими силами. Художник предложение принимает и тут в игру вступаем мы. Перед нами - головоломка от первого лица, красивая и иносказательная, но слишком уж шероховатая. Самая главная трудность - постановка задач, очень уж часто я застревал с вопросом "а чего добиться-то надо?". Неторопливый шаг героя так же может стать достаточно раздражающим, особенно к концу. Но в целом, игра оставила приятное послевкусие. Можно поиграть.			</div>

																<blockquote class="bb_blockquote"><a class="bb_link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/curator/9686972/" target="_blank" rel="">Follow "<b>First Person Exploration and Puzzle Games</b>" for more games like this!</a></blockquote><br>This game is absolutely beautiful, but unfortunately that's about all it has going for it.  There's no real storyline <i>(other than the intro video)</i>, and the puzzles are consistently terrible.<br><br>The second puzzle (the bridge puzzle) was one of the most grueling, infuriating puzzles in any game I've ever played.  It should've taken me five minutes, but instead it took me 30, because the buttons you need to press to experiment are 45+ seconds of walking apart.  To make matters worse, there is wind trying to push you off the tiny walkways, and if you fall you get sent back to the start of the puzzle.  This leads to new possible solutions, making the puzzle more complicated than it needs to be. I spent a long time considering how to solve the puzzle using this mechanic, only to figure out it's not needed, meaning the wind and falling serve no purpose except to frustrate the player.<br><br>In another example, in one of the puzzles you click on a praying table to close your eyes, then click again to open your eyes.  When you open your eyes... nothing has changed.  I thought for sure that interacting with the table would change something, but I explored for a long time and didn't find anything.  Literally nothing happens.  I had to look up the solution.  It turns out the game wants you to close your eyes and just... wait in darkness, for around 15 seconds, after which something will change.  How the hell was I supposed to figure that out if the game makes no attempt to tell me?  How is that even a puzzle!?<br><br>I finally quit the game after the fourth puzzle involving walking long distances to press buttons.  This game clearly isn't for me.  Hilariously, when you try to quit, the game stops responding and you need to use ctrl+alt+delete to close out of it.<br><br>Perhaps someone who can overlook terrible grueling puzzles and just enjoy the beauty of the game will enjoy this.  However for everyone else, look elsewhere.			</div>

																This is not a good puzze game, it is a mediocre one. The areas are made so you want to explore a bit, bu you're on a timer, so you run looking for puzzles and their solutions, while on the run. To make it worse, you have to travel a long way from one puzzle to another, like up a very tall spiral staircase, or a detour along a circular maze bridge. Not to mention that unless you have an ear for music and know how to read notes, the only way to solve the piano boat puzzle is if you do it correctly by chance. This game is badly designed, and poorly executed.			</div>

			A Review about Summertime Madness. A walking simulator with a lot of puzzles : https://store.steampowered.com/app/1360550/Summertime_Madness/ Please give the AWG Group some love and check their...		</div>
	</div>
</div><br><br><br>Summertime Madness is a cartoon, high detailed puzzle game that I fell in a love heat relationship in an instant.<br><br><br>This is the first game created byDP Games Inc who is entering the world of Steam with Summertime Madness.<br><br><br><div class="bb_h1">Gameplay / Story</div><br><br>War is everywhere, but you lonely artist got a deal with god or the devil, does not make any difference, trust me.<br><br>Well, well what can you expect from a game Tagged with complex story, dystopia and the supernatural? Yeah, not much because this game has tags that are not understandable from my side.<br><br>You start as an Artist going into his paintings to find… a friend? Whatsoever, you have only 6 hours to leave this place and my first questions is: Why? Why would I want to leave this world? Why going into it in the first way? This makes no sense.<br><br>The game itself is beautiful, it's colourful, and the music fits in the game. You start on a beautiful island and have to solve puzzles that normally is within, building things up. Later, you have to go into a gigantic lighthouse and circle platforms to find a gigantic statue who prays to you until you get this situation solved. I had a lot of fun but had to stop at the music puzzle, since I have no clue about music and had to go on Google and check it I have stopped right there. But i would have played further.<br><br><br><div class="bb_h1">Pro</div><br><br>+ great music<br>+ artwork is so colourful and friendly<br>+ puzzle sections are unique<br>+ the narration is spot on<br><br><div class="bb_h1">Contra</div><br>- the puzzles seem to become more and more complicated<br>- running is still slow<br>-  you can get hints which will cost 15 minutes of time but I could not use them or activate the hints.<br><br><br><div class="bb_h1">Conclusion/ Who will enjoy the game?</div><br><br>Summertime Madness  offers a  nice game with colourful graphics and a music fitting into this game. The puzzles are nice, and I think besides of me who has no clue on puzzles pretty easy to.<br><br><br>So who will enjoy this game? Do you like puzzles? Interactive ones, not the jigsaw puzzles. This game is fantastic for that when you need  relaxing puzzle gaming while a gigantic clock reminds you about immediate death!<br><br><br><br><a class="bb_link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/curator/26335619-Adult-World-Gamers/" target="_blank" rel=""> I recommend checking the AWG group for more detailed reviews </a>			</div>

																Summertime Madness has some good things going for it, with some nice visuals and soundtrack which can help relax in the game's early-mid stages.<br><br>However, while some puzzles have good ideas behind them, most do not seem fully fledged. At no point did I ever feel a true sense of accomplishment for solving a puzzle, and one of the puzzles in particular is absolutely awful in concept.<br><br>Furthermore, I spent the majority of the game walking, which is pretty slow relative to the size of game's areas even when running. I expect to spend the majority of a puzzle game trying to solve puzzles.<br><br>Finally, the time limit mechanic seems to directly contradict the theme of the game. Sure, it fits in the narrative, but the narrative is essentially just a cap of cutscenes at the start and end of the game. But thematically, the game seems to be begging you to relax and enjoy the scenery and to take your time with it. But then they whack a 6 hour time limit on to it, which is plenty generous for a game that took me around 2 hours but I always had that sinking feeling that if I didn't rush, I might end up frustrated and have to restart the whole game. And re-doing puzzles that are primarily walking already, isn't my idea of fun.			</div>

																This game is beautiful but not a good puzzle game. Maybe i'm just too acclimated to these kinds of game but i often found them to be either really easy to do or really confusing because this is a game full of really simple puzzles wrapped in winding level design that seems designed to waste time in the worst way. Also you have 6 hours to work with in a game that would take around 2-3 so using hints doesn't really impact much, not like you'd need them for most puzzles.			</div>

																<blockquote class="bb_blockquote"><a class="bb_link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/curator/32732116-IndieGems/" target="_blank" rel="">Follow our curator page: <b>IndieGems</b> if you like and want to see more reviews like this one.</a></blockquote><div class="bb_h1">Story:</div>When a young talented painter’s city comes under heavy attack of a war he tries to focus on his painting. Out of nowhere a stranger suddenly shows up with a particular odd deal. A deal to visit the world within his painting, to escape from the horrors happening outside.<br>But there is a catch, if the painter doesn’t make it back out of the painting before midnight, he’ll be trapped in there forever. And so his journey begins, as he accepts the deal.<br>Before and after the painter's journey there is voice over while during the journey there has been made room for interpretive storytelling.<br><br><div class="bb_h1">Gameplay:</div>Right from the moment you dip your toe in the world of the painting the controls get explained to you. While keeping an eye out for several different collectables and even a few secrets, the gameplay with a very few other puzzles, like playing a piano and making sure cogs are in the right order, is mostly about running around and flipping switches in a maze/labyrinth like setting. Which in all fairness sometimes can be very frustrating instead of fun and challenging and it will test your patience.<br>There are different modes you can play. Explorer with no time limit, classic with a six hour time limit, advanced for a three hour time limit. Beating one of these will unlock expert mode where you have one hour to complete the game. You’re also provided with a hint option in the form of a pocket watch for when you find yourself stuck. Do note that this will add time to your run.<br><br><div class="bb_h1">Visuals:</div>A stunning eye pleaser. It really feels like you get submerged into a painting. Loved every bit of it.<br>There is also an option under video while being in game to adjust the paint effect to your liking.<br><br><div class="bb_h1">Sound:</div>Adored the sound, it was so peaceful and relaxing that it even faded away in the back of my mind while running around like a lunatic trying to find which lever opens what where who.<br><br><div class="bb_h1">Controls:</div>I played with my controller and everything felt very smooth and easy. Only one small thing: the hitboxes felt very small. I briefly tested it and it seems keyboard mouse is good to go too.<br><br><div class="bb_h1">Issues:</div>I don’t recall seeing a warning for flashing, at some point there was lightning, I’m not photosensitive but the lightning was even harsh on me. So be aware of that if you’re sensitive to it.<br>There is a certain part where you have to swap between day and night, this makes it so that paths, levers and gates are in a different space. My poor brain does not have the capacity to remember all of that and I’ve spent so much time running around like a headless chicken trying to figure it out.<br>During a part of the game you will encounter a very sharp horrible sound, which is part of a puzzle, but lil ol’sensitive me really was not happy with it.<br>The song summertime madness gets stuck in your head of the title. Can’t just be me right?<br><br><div class="bb_h1">Closing word:</div>It’s games like these that make me wonder why steam doesn’t have a rate button between thumbs up and down since the game isn’t bad but also not super wow omg so good. I feel myself torn with mixed feelings to make a choice between those two thumbs.<br>There were moments I felt frustrated and closed the game only to boot it back up a little later to continue. A true love hate relationship. Yet in the end I did press a thumb up, barely tho. For the little things in the game, the visual beauty, the beautiful music and the story we see at the very end. A story that lingered for a while. Perhaps I’m a little biassed being an art lover. Every time I saw a little reference or a wink to a painter like van Gogh, Dali, Margriet etc, I smiled a little. I found some collectables and I think a secret even and also missed a lot of collectable stuff and perhaps more secrets. I enjoyed the scenery and even took time to throw some rocks in the water, fooling around a bit here and there, catching fireflies not knowing if it’s even an achievement or not. Cause why not? I was playing on explorer since I prefer more relaxing non timed games.<br>And I have to be honest to myself and say I did not regret this journey. That despite some frustrations, knowing the puzzles a bit better now I am willing to jump back in to go collect those collectables perhaps even try the timed challenges.<br>If you pick it up and experience a little bit of motion sickness then you can adjust the field of view in settings, this helped me to get rid of that icky feeling.<br><br>With love,<br>Tchii<br><blockquote class="bb_blockquote">I received the product for free. I did not receive any compensation to write this review. The opinions represented here are entirely my own and were not influenced in any way.</blockquote>			</div>

																Summertime Madness appeared to be a game that is just up my alley. It has all of the elements - art, music, and puzzles. It also has an optional timer for achievements.  It started out great... figuring out how to get off a boat, turning platforms to build a path. And, then it took a downhill turn for me. The game evolves into a series of mazes and switches in an Escher-like house, a time-warped train station, a series of doors, and (seemingly) endless stairs/paths.<br><br>To add insult to injury, I was well on my way to making a successful 6 hour run when I selected the wrong door and my clock advanced to a quick 'game over.'  Evidently, I was not the only frustrated player because the development team listened and released their 1.2 patch which made these areas less punishing.<br><br>In view of this responsiveness on their part and the improvements made to these areas, I am changing my opinion from  'do not recommend' to a 'recommend with caveats.'<br><br>Summertime Madness has some nice features. It can be played without a time limit and there are some very creative moments and interesting mechanics along the way.  The artwork is enjoyable and there is a diversity of puzzles and scenery. For completionists, it is apt to be frustrating as there are mazes that must be executed quickly to meet the more challenging achievements (completing the game in 3 hours and then in 1 hour).<br><br>Despite the game update, I continued to find the final stairway/maze section very confusing and I ran out of game time more than once. The good news is that there is no penalty for starting a chapter over. I did finally resort to a walk through (thank you, Sigmar's Sausage!) to see what a successful maze journey looked like. With this in mind, I was able to complete the game to earn the 'done in 6 hours' achievement. Turns out, there is a new feature that I could have used to avoid this time squeeze, but I did not fully understand the mechanics.<br><br>I am now planning to circle back through, without time limits, and pick up a number of missed achievements. Perhaps I will do some maze mapping and try for a 3 hour run...			</div>

																I watched some streamers test the game and I decided to give it a try.<br><br>There are several quotes to some of my favorite painters and the music really helps you to relax and to focus on the game.<br><br>The puzzles are quite challenging and they are never trivial: it is a pleasure to explore this surreal world in all his corners.<br><br>Totally worth its price.			</div>

																-90%OFF ￥3.5买的，所以这个差评就不给了<br><br>不知道有多少人和我一样是看见商店页的宣传画面加的愿望单，游戏的优点是第一眼比较抓眼的画面和极低的入库价格，本质上是一个解谜游戏。但要说缺点，我的评价是91开，缺点占9成。<br><br>为什么这个游戏画面看着不错却有这么多缺点？简单来说就是我玩着不爽，往里说就是游戏的解谜设计处处都有问题。首先这是一款第一人称解谜游戏，剧情看简介，画面是高明暗反差的卡通手绘风格，第一人称解谜意味着玩家无法从上帝视角观察整个谜题，这就要求制作组有足够优秀的能力设计好整个谜题以致于不会让玩家以第一人称绕晕在谜题中。以我的游玩体验来看，游戏的谜题设计部分糟糕透了。我上一款玩的解谜游戏是《The Pedestrian》，The Pedestrian的谜题展现形式以及谜题设计我给满分。而这款游戏，几乎全是迷宫谜题，什么是迷宫谜题呢？就是当你以第一人称在迷宫内，你看到的只有前面的路和两边的高墙，你需要凭记忆不断往返试错来走出这个迷宫，当你在迷宫谜题内，解题方法就不是纯靠脑子了，虽然你花了大量时间，但都被跑路过程消耗了，实际上你碰到的开关就那么几个。从第二章灯塔内部的三个拼图，我隐约有点烦躁的感觉。在游戏里有走路和奔跑两种状态，全程奔跑也需要花大量时间浪费在往返之间，之后的车站关卡游戏也毫无引导提示，高反差风格加上跑路不断浪费的时间很容易会让玩家失去耐心。你从地图一头跑到另外一头只为了按下一个开关，按下开关后你还得跑回去，尤其是最后一关《时间》这是整个游戏最让我下头的关卡，低透明度的向上延伸的阶梯离远了就看不见，而阶梯的分支又是死胡同，走错了需要原路返回到岔路口，玩家要不断跑来跑去试错，我在玩这一关的时候有尤为明显的感觉，制作组是故意把楼梯拉长了，你懂我意思吧，原来走3步就能走到头的楼梯，制作组硬是给你拉长到了10步。虽然看着整个场景很大楼梯很长，但本质还是以跑路消耗玩家的时间和耐心，而谜题质量还是那个迷宫谜题，大家都爱看小白鼠走迷宫，但谁也不想做迷宫里的那只小白鼠。另外一个缺点是游戏的音效，游戏有大量让人难以忍受的中高频噪音，进游戏会让玩家选择通关时间，时间到了以后走不出去就会被困在画里，游戏的音效设计则加重了这种紧张感，我在玩到中后章节几乎是开最小音量玩的，玩这个游戏我居然还会不断冒冷汗，本来谜题设计的就很糟糕，结果音效设计更糟糕，并且游戏中的人物建筑巨大，看的我真的有种巨物恐惧症。<br><br>最后提一下购买建议，首先原价肯定是不值得推荐，只要看一看总的评价就知道，如果游戏足够优秀，不会只有这点评价。如果游戏降到史低￥3.5，你首先应该考虑的是你这3个小时能不能用来做别的更有意义的事或者玩别的更加好玩的游戏，如果没有，其次考虑自己适不适合玩解谜游戏，或者对这类游戏感不感兴趣，如果以上两点都ok，再问自己最后一个问题，你真的想花这3个小时折磨自己吗？			</div>

																絵の中から脱出する一人称視点の謎解きゲーム。一部ホラーっぽい演出がある。<br>初見でいろいろ探索して一周3~4時間程度。その後実績解除のため二周しましたが、慣れれば一時間かからずにクリアできます。<br>良い点<br>映像が良い。絵の中にいるような雰囲気がある。<br>音楽も景色に合っていて良い。<br>悪い点<br>セーブがチャプター毎のオートセーブのみ。<br>上にも書いたが、探索しなければ一時間かからずに終わるのでボリュームが少ない。<br>謎解き要素が微妙。考えるより歩き回る感じだった。歩いて仕掛けを起動して、また歩いては仕掛けを起動して……、の繰り返し。もう少し頭を使わせてほしかった。<br>ストーリー。悪いわけではないが、別になくても良いように思う。<br><br>謎解きパズルゲームにしては難易度が低く移動が多い。<br>映像を楽しむウォーキングシミュにしては歩ける範囲が狭いしパズルが煩わしい。<br>どちらにしてもおすすめし難いゲームでした。<br>			</div>

																Gra zaczyna się w 1945 roku w zniszczonej Pradze, gdzie w jednej z kamienic malarz tworzy swoje obrazy. Odwiedza go tajemniczy gość, który oferuje artyście spędzenie czasu z dala od wojny i ponurej rzeczywistości – tym miejscem jest obraz, nad którym plastyk pracuje. Malarz przystaje na ofertę i przenosi się do obrazu. Nie może jednak tam spędzić dłużej niż 6 godzin, inaczej zostanie w płótnie na zawsze (długość tego czasu zależy od poziomu trudności jaki wybierzemy – na najwyższym jest to godzina). W nim zwiedza świat i rozwiązuje łamigłówki, które niestety z czasem zamieniają się w latanie po labiryntach schodów. Szkoda. Liczyłem na lekką i przyjemna mystopodobną grę i w sumie gdzieniegdzie taka jest, ale jednak więcej czasu spędzimy na szukaniu właściwych przejść, aby znaleźć odpowiedni przełącznik.<br><br>Co do samych zagadek na początku trafiamy na statek, na którym musimy otwierać dostęp do dzwonków, których dźwięk sprawia, że pokazuje się kolejna część statku jak i samej wyspy. Gdzie indziej musimy odpowiednio ustawiać platformy, by dostać się do wyjścia. Jest też miejsce na prostą zagadkę dźwiękową. Jednak najbardziej spodobała mi się zagadka z pokręconym korytarzem i manipulacją czasu, tak aby wejść przez odpowiednie drzwi. Niestety jest też jedna zagadka, która wymusza na nas wejście w ustawienia menu. Na niej najdłużej się zaciąłem, bo nie przypuszczałem, że coś takiego będzie miało miejsce (a mogłem się domyślić, bo już wtedy gra skręciła w surrealistyczny kierunek).<br><br>Graficznie jest w porządku, choć tekstury nie są szczegółowe. Ładne obrazki 2D na początku i końcu rozgrywki. Muzyczka przyjemna. Dla wielu graczy dużym plusem będą wymagające osiągnięcia. Trzeba być naprawdę spostrzegawczym i mieć szósty zmysł, aby je wszystkie odkryć (poza tymi, od których zależy poziom trudności). Całość zajęła mi około 3 godziny.<br><br>Jest to bardzo nierówna produkcja, w której niektóre elementy mi się podobały a inne irytowały. Niemniej kupiłem ją za niecałe 14 złotych i za takie pieniądze można zagrać.			</div>

																Игра в целом приятная и небезынтересная, но я все же ожидала большего от нее. Это история некого художника из Праги. В 1945 году незнакомец предложил ему спрятаться от бомбардировок в собственной картине, но нужно за несколько часов найти путь обратно, иначе художник навсегда останется в воображаемом мире. <br>Плюсы игры:  <br> - Приятная, атмосферная графика, красочные миры<br> - Есть интересные головоломки<br> - Вполне серьезный сюжет.<br>Чем она разочаровала:<br> - Во-первых, игра действительно на время. Правда, даже с застреваниями, тупками и подсказками (за которые штраф откусывается от оставшегося времени) я прошла почти в два раза быстрее, чем нужно, но все равно ощущение, что часики тикают, очень раздражает.<br> - Многовато лабиринтов. Первый пройти интересно, второй интересно, потом появляется ощущение, что надоело. Мир с поездом вызывает максимальное раздражение: там и карту с собой не возьмешь, и есть несколько этажей, и конечная цель далеко не сразу ясна.<br> - И наконец, сюжет по сути подается двумя блоками в начале и в конце, а между ними никак не развивается. Сюжет отдельно, геймплей отдельно.<br>7/10<br><br><div class="dynamiclink_box " onclick="DynamicLink_PlayYouTubeVideoInline( this, &quot;BNj7Gw1r-RQ&quot; );">

																The game is just... awesome! <br><br>The grapich style perfectly marries both the music and the gameplay, creating a fascinating and original world.<br>About the world i've particularly enjoyed the brutal (but well done) alternance between paceful and graceful atmospheres and gloomy and disturbing ones. <br><br>From the gameplay point of view the game feel comfortable and fluid for all the kind of players (from the casual one to the "achievements hunter") especially thanks to the different kind of difficulties you can choose from.<br>There is no real endgame contents but still there is a kind of replayability with an extrame challenging 1-hour-run and a lot of hidden and fun collectibles to find!  <br>On explorer mode you will be free to explore, with no pressure and no time-limit, the game world with all its easter eggs, trophies and you can just enjoy some breathtaking landscapes. <br><br>If you like puzzle-games with well done background story and an outstanding art design you shouldn't miss Summertime Madness, also due to its affordable price!			</div>

																i wanted to enjoy this game. played it during a indie fest iirc and only got around to playing it 2 years later. but the puzzles arent really puzzles, more of a test of endurance. nothings intellectually stimulating and just feels like a bore. not to mention, the controls for some of these are really jank making the puzzles much more infuriating than they otherwise should be (looking at the flower scales specifically here). yeah i could look up answers just to get through it quickly to see what the end is but the story isnt interesting enough for me to care to do so. <br>game does look really nice though, especially with the paint effect ill give it that			</div>

																This is a good first-person puzzle game, with a surprisingly low price. The game is really beautiful to look at; the grass wind effect deserves a special mention. The music is relaxing and fits the game well.<br><br>The puzzles are varied, and have a good level of difficulty. There's an in-game hint system that can help you if you get really stuck somewhere. The game has a good amount of secrets and achievements outside of the main story, and even some intended secret skips that can be used for speedrunning.<br><br>You're supposed to complete the game before a certain timer ends, but you can choose a difficulty mode without the timer, if that's a problem for you. However, I recommend the normal difficulty mode for a first playthrough, as the timer is very lenient: I completed the game without problems with that timer, and I play games rather slowly, trying to find secrets everywhere and looking at the scenery.			</div>

																Общая оценка: 3/10<br><br>Ща бомбить буду.<br>Когда-то давным давно, еще в стадии демки, эта игра вызвала у меня интерес. Позже эта игра была куплена и отложена в "ящик".<br>Ну-с, настало время ее пройти.<br><br>По началу игра интересная: остров, корабль... то, что было в демке. <br>Но вот как только появляется Маяк, появляются некие подозрения, что игра начала отталкивать. И знаете чем? Хождением! Загадки еще более менее, но решаются быстро. А вот дойти до места - это уже тихий ад унылости. Обожаю игры, где надо ходить, но тут почему-то оно максимально уныло, ибо пейзажи не меняются, а ты все равно идешь, и идешь, и идешь. <br><br>Потом появляется локация словно списанная с картины Маурица Эшера. Куча лестниц! Спасибо, что у меня нет топографического кретинизма, но людям, которые могут заблудиться в двух соснах, я крайне категорически не рекомендую покупать эту игру!<br><br>Ладно, это пока всё кажется весело и еще норм по разгадыванию.<br>Но, а потом появляется она, королева локаций в данной игре - город с прошлым и будущем. И вот тут я закончився :\<br>Знаете что, уважаемые разработчики, создавать огромную локацию и к ней давать карту нарисованную ногой, что нельзя брать с собой - это просто сверх издевательство над игроком. Хотелось уже было глянуть, что да как это пройти, но увидев, что люди МИНИМУМ на этот город тратят час, я просто закрыл игру и удалил её к ч ё р т о в о й бабушке. <br>Нет желания больше это проходить. <br><br>Отдельно напишу. Мм, я понимаю, что разрабы крайне умные и продвинутые во всех сферах, но спешу вас удивить: НЕ ВСЕ В ЭТОМ МИРЕ ЗНАЮТ НОТЫ. Если вы пихаете такое, то давайте хоть какие-то пояснения, как ноты располагаются на нотном стане, о название котором я вообще впервые слышу, ИБО НЕ МУЗЫКАНТ, АЛЛО! Для решения этой к.о.н.ч... загадки пришлось гуглить расположение нот! Почему игра допускает такие моменты, что приходиться гуглить то, что НЕВОЗМОЖНО решить без помощи!?!<br><br>И завершу своё горение н а и т у п е й ш и м ГГ. Знаете что, если бы ко мне пришел дядя и задал вопрос: Хочешь ли ты покинуть этот (о т б и т ы й) мир и пройтись по своему миру с холста? Но знай, что до полуночи тебе нужно вернуться!<br>Мой ответ был бы таков: СУЙ МЕНЯ В МОЙ МИР И Я БОЛЬШЕ ОТ ТУДА НЕ ВЫЙДУ!!!!!!!!!<br>Думаете ГГ нужно задумываться о побеге?? НЕТ! За окном ГГ вторая мировая война!! Поблуждать осознанно в раю, чтобы к полуночи вернуться в ад, в котором в тебя может каждую секунду прилететь снаряд??!! Разрабы, вы чо смеетесь или куда?!?!?!<br><span class="bb_spoiler"><span>Ща просто в голосину. Для интереса уже досмотрел в ютубе, что будет в конце. И знаете что? ГГ размазало прилётом! Это было на столько предсказуемо!</span></span><br><br>Крч, демка была вкусной, но сама игра то слово, что стим просто запикает!!!			</div>

																In this game you can choose to beat the game within a time zone of 6 hours (classic mode) or 3 hours (advanced mode). But the ingame time is not the same as real life time.<br>If you don't like this there is also a third option where you can solve the game without time limit (explorer mode)<br><br>The game has an automatic save system.<br>I like the game art and the puzzles. I am over halfway and the puzzles are not that difficult. And if there is some place where you are stuck, you can ask for a hint. But a hint cost time if you are playing in classic or advanced mode.<br><br>Also, there are secret items to find.<br><br>Here is my walkthrough for the first 6 puzzles: <div class="dynamiclink_box " onclick="DynamicLink_PlayYouTubeVideoInline( this, &quot;uyfWI_BmwZk&quot; );">

																El juego trata de un pintor que se mete en sus cuadros huyendo de la guerra. Tienes que encontrar la forma de salir de ellos resolviendo puzzles antes de que termine el tiempo, por suerte hay un modo sin tiempo para los que somos más torpes resolviendo puzzles. Algunos son bastantes complicados así que tenéis horas de entretenimiento.<br>También cabe destacar que los gráficos son muy bonitos y la música muy relajante.			</div>

																Глубокие переживания художника, которые демонстрируются через образы в игре. Визуал, как и креативность уровней мое почтение. Музыка не зацепила, как и неоновый город, где и пришлось прерваться.. очень тяжелая головоломка. Какой глубинный смысл в том, что надо открыть 2 пары ворот из разного времени? 15% прошло всю игру, стоит задуматься..			</div>

																Gostei que o jogo é focado em exploração porém os puzzles acabam em muitas partes sendo cansativos e difíceis, me fez desistir do jogo quando cheguei na metade, também me deu um pouco de náusea por causa do motion sickness mas se você tem paciência e um cérebro que não frita fácil, vai que ele é daora :)			</div>

																I played it for a couple of hours now  and I find it really enjoyable. <br>The design of the locations and the gorgeous style is really similar to the work of Miyazaki's (which I love) and also the music is very soothing and relaxing.<br><br>The puzzles don't seem particularly difficult (at least until now) and I haven't used and hint yet. <br>During some parts of the game you have to walk for a little bit (Bridges), but personally I really liked taking my time to explore the game levels and details, as that the particular style (oilpaint like) is oone of the strong point of the game.<br><br>It is a game that must definitely be lived with a lot of calm and attention, and perhaps not very suitable for those who are looking for brainy and challenging puzzles, but for all those who are into in something that is close to a walk-journey, this is definitely an adventure worth living, which leaves something behind.<br>(Also worth considering the price)			</div>

																Pour l'instant 1h30 de gameplay très agréable, et au vu des succès qui restent à débloquer, je suis encore loin de l'avoir fini.<br><br>Sur le catalogue, les graphismes et la bande-son m'ont direct séduite, et ça se confirme en jouant. Mais si l'ambiance est poétique, ne vous laissez pas duper  : c'est bien un jeu de casse-tête, il faudra vous activer les méninges.<br><br>Déprimé par un monde en guerre, vous avez accepté de voyager dans un de vos tableaux. Le jeu consiste à l'explorer et surtout, à trouver la sortie. Vous ouvrez les yeux dans ce paysage, avec pour seule indication les contrôles (clavier et souris). A vous de trouver où aller et quoi faire pour progresser.<br><br>Il sera assez simple de voir quelles choses ou mécanismes permettent d'avancer. En revanche, comment les mettre en oeuvre : là réside toute la difficulté. Si la progression par lieux semble linéaire (pas besoin de retourner plusieurs fois aux 4 coins de la map), au sein d'un même casse-tête, vous aurez besoin de nombreuses manipulations et essais. Du style vous faites un truc quelque part, ça défait de l'autre côté. Ca demande pas mal de projection mentale, et d'orientation dans l'espace et dans le temps.<br><br>Les graphismes et la musique douce rendent l'expérience très agréable. Même quand c'est dur, on n'a pas envie de ragequit.<br><br>C'est un jeu qui vaut vraiment le coup, si vous le voyez en promo, foncez sans hésiter !			</div>

																这是一款带有解谜玩法的走路模拟器。<br><br>游戏的画面是我觉得最赞的地方了，整体偏油画的感觉，游戏中各个场景也非常有味道，个人觉得比较赞的几个场景就是初始场景和被机械鲸鱼吞入肚中之后的哪个能够通过沙漏来回切换时间场景。<br><br>而且游戏很巧妙的让玩家总会回到初始场景上，总体来说，游戏出现的特殊场景不多，但是却非常巧妙的意外的让人觉得画面不错。<br><br>游戏的剧情说的是二战时候的布拉格有一个画家，因为当时正是二战苏德战争的时候，由于战争的惨烈度越来越高，导致画家越来越痴迷于描绘美丽的风景画面。<br><br>直到某天晚上，一个神秘人出现在画家的房子里，跟他提出了一个交易，让画家能够进入自己画出的世界中用以躲避战争，但是他必须在午夜前找到回到现实世界的路，不然他的灵魂将永远困在画中。<br><br>画家当时又孤独，又被街上飘来的死亡气息吓到了，于是答应了交易，进入了画中。<br><br>然后画家在画中完成了所有的谜题，终于回到了现实。正在画家思考如何将画中的遭遇画出来的时候，午夜12点到了，布拉格被炸弹夷为了平地，画家也被炸死。<br><br>之后幸存者找到了这副完好无损的油画，现在仍然保存在博物馆中。<br><br>呃，老实说这个结局我是没太搞懂的，因为游戏设定了一个时间，我玩的结局是从在规定时间内从画中出来了，画家被炸死为结局，就是不知道如果没在规定时间从画中出来又会是怎么样。<br><br>不过估计也是这么个结局吧？反正12点布拉格就会被炸弹夷为平地，画家进不进入画中，其实都是被炸死这么一个结局就是了。<br><br>玩法上，具体就是走路+解谜，个人觉得有两个谜题算是比较恶心人的，一个就是彭罗斯阶梯那一关，我在那里来回瞎转，迷路了十几分钟，其次就是车站那一关，来回转悠巴拉开关不说，还要用沙漏切换时间。<br><br>而最最让人蛋疼的就是最后一关时间，玩家全程在多个破楼梯上来回走就算了，规定时间还会快速减少，让我一度以为会被困死在那一关上。<br><br>游戏谜题的总体难度不是特别高，就是走路来回绕来绕去比较烦，难度上，游戏有三种难度，最简单的一个是没有限制时间，另外两个难度一个是要求现实时间6小时通关，一个是要求3小时。<br><br>游戏内置了提示，每用一次会消耗15分钟，但是这个提示怎么说呢，不怎么好用，一点都不明显。反正使用六小时的那个难度通关绰绰有余，就算最后一关，怀表的秒针消失，分针按照秒针的速度走，通关时间也是足够的，反而是三小时那个，如果不是玩的特别熟练，可能时间就稍微有些不够了--完全不用提示的话应该够？反正我是比较蠢，每一关都用了提示，但是依然没什么卵用，最后还是去找了视频才顺利通关。<br><br>评分<br>8/10<br>游戏的画面还是非常惊艳的，解谜不难，但是有几关的设定还是挺精妙的。<br>就是走路速度太慢，有些解谜就是全程让玩家走来走去，速度太慢让人心急。<br>3小时左右就能通关，游玩体验不如《艾迪芬奇的记忆》，将近40块的价格有点小贵，半价的话就非常划得来了。<br>整体来说是一个还算优秀的小品级走路模拟器。<br><blockquote class="bb_blockquote">欢迎关注我们的鉴赏家:<a class="bb_link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/curator/35402982/" target="_blank" rel="">走心评测</a> 遵从内心，写出真实感受<br>欢迎加入我们Steam组:<a class="bb_link" href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/ZXPC" target="_blank" rel="">走心评测</a> 点击加入，一起探索游戏的乐趣<br>喜欢这篇评论，也麻烦点个赞，让更多人能够看到！</blockquote>			</div>

																I wish there was a thumb that is pointing to the right because I can neither totally recommend nor not recommend this game. I mean, it's colorful and I love puzzle games, but I am not a big fan of all the puzzles in the game (especially the one with the platforms you have to rotate to get to the door). It's still a good game. I think that levels like "Memories of the Future" are way too complex (at least for me). I stopped playing the game when I reached this level because it got way too frustrating.			</div>

																The puzzles in this game is... well... mostly flipping switches... not that it's not fun... just.. a little simple. The "hard" part of the game are the illogical part where it's impossible to solve without the hint from the pocket watch... so i wouldn't call those a puzzle imo... <br><br>The art work is pretty but some part of it could be an eye sore... The music just isn't my type most of the time and pretty depressing than relaxing. So it turned out to be a "meh" experience for me in overall... kinda hard to rate the review on this one really.. more like a 50/50.			</div>

																Excellent music with both elegant story and narration, but tragically falls short in classic indie fashion. An art style that's too obsessed with appearing simple and charming. It instead comes off as lifeless, and at it's worst, such as the levels "Memories from the Future," and "The Castle," this and the chosen color palette become downright hideous. I should clarify that this isn't damning on it's own and I don't think it comes from a place of incompetence, but for a game that insists you run around and double back as much as this one, the problem becomes glaring. <br><br>The loudest issue however is the puzzles, too many of which gain their difficulty from tricking the player rather than displaying a real challenge, one of which is laughably gimmicky, and nearly all of which feel incredibly drawn-out. Most levels consist of much, much more walking and time wasting than actual puzzle solving, which might provide thematic tension to an ever-ticking clock, but is a terrible detriment to a long-term puzzle game.<br><br>This culminates in a final level that feels like a personal insult, which includes jarringly confusing graphics that are purposely meant to waste time, terribly bored "puzzle" design, with very little time needed to think about the solution but a whole hell of a lot of time needed to complete, not to mention <span class="bb_spoiler"><span> a timer that speeds to 15 minutes remaining, nullifying your performance in the rest of the game up to this point </span></span> .<br><br>A portion of this critique might sounds similar to popular sentiments about The Witness, and I want to make it clear this is a different beast. While The Witness is often griped for having a lot of relative time spend walking and time wasting, it's typically spent exploring the largely open-world play area. Summertime Madness is extremely linear with no exploration, and entirely level-based save a couple brief visits to the 'hub' area. <br><br>I couldn't fit this sentence anywhere else and it doesn't worsen the experience, but this game also includes the absolute worst ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ easter eggs I've ever seen in a video game. Just bizarrely bad.<br><br>Overall I'm disappointed by the puzzle design and artificial difficulty by length, but if you're more disposed toward the low-poly graphics or are even properly charmed by them, I imagine the length I complained about might just be a positive. However, I still can't recommend the 13 dollar (11 dollar at time of purchase) price tag.			</div>

																This game is a totally worth "short" puzzle explorative experience with a historical touch to it and a few fresh puzzle ideas that get really well complemented with it's gameplay mechanics, but despite of this I would like to point a few big mistakes the game makes and that you should take in count when playing:<br><br>-The level design and the ideas on it are awesome, but there are some elements on it that are very important for the puzzles but they are bad designed visually as they sometimes feel hard to see.<br><br>-The puzzles are really great and original, but I think that the difficulty progresion doesn't exist as it feels like there a lot of spikes during the game.<br><br>-The game has a "clue/hints" system that could be better as it sometimes gives you directly the solution to the puzzle instead of guiding you to it. Despite of that the gameplay mechanic that gets combined with this part of the gameplay experience is pretty original and awesome.<br><br>Here you have a full walkthrough/gameplay that might be useful to you: <div class="dynamiclink_box " onclick="DynamicLink_PlayYouTubeVideoInline( this, &quot;DYycQebrer8&quot; );">

																Такое дерьмище, задачи уровень бог, некоторые слишком замудренные, а остальные просто не имеют логики. Конец дак вообще убил. Не советую эту игру, скучная однообразная, если купите игру и начнете в нее играть, то мне жаль вас, ваши дентги, ваше время и нервы. Миссии не имеют смысла, сюжета ноль. Попал в картину? Ну и оставайся там зае.ал, живи в своем воображаемом мире и все, нет надо выбираться. 1 из 1000000000000000000000000000000 говнее говна не видел еще.<br>			</div>

																异想天开的意识流解谜，游戏普通难度限定6小时通关，高难度限定3小时通关，目前前4个遇到的谜题，我这个笨比花了45分钟左右，囊括了开关逻辑谜题、类似埃舍尔《相对性》的楼梯谜题（笨比绕了半天路，发现该互动的没互动）、物件配重谜题等，具体难度还可以。价格方面还行，犹豫不定的，可以拿之前的 超阈值空间 或者 花园之间 做一下类比。			</div>

																Good art style, doesn't have any great ideas of its own though gameplay wise, its pretty short and gameplay is mostly meaningless. Enjoyed some bits and hated other bits, too much unnecessary walking and a very annoying puzzle might turn some people off... 5.5/10 for me.			</div>

																A welcome surprise!  It's quite a gorgeous game in many ways and really evoked some strong feelings in places just with very effective atmosphere setting!<br><br>One puzzle can get in the sea, I still don't understand how you're meant to find the solution other than by horrific trial and error, but everything else was challenging in a fun way, solutions felt really satisfying!<br><br>It is a bit fond of confusing mazes, and sometimes I felt like I was expected to be able to mentally juggle pieces in my head way over what I'm capable of doing, but I did get through it			</div>

																Summertime Madness is not a game. Is a sensorial experience that allow you to visit the oniric world of a painter and all the madness associated. <br>I'm not a fan of puzzle games but this is something different; enigma are only a part of the game. Yet considering the time limit that you have in the standard mode, you still have time to admire all the piece of arts and to get in love with the music.<br><br>At this price, the game is absolutely valuable and worth.			</div>

																This game will make you agree with the Rolling Stones, when they talked about sympathy for the devil.<br>I love its atmosphere, it is like a inner trip into painter’s feeling, from the peace of the first settings, to the despair of the last ones.<br>The music is amazing, and it will contribute to make you feel part of the universe.<br><br>Totally worth the price, super recommended!<br>			</div>

</div><br><br>For a puzzler that you can sit down and play through in an afternoon, there seems to be so much more in the world that I didn’t get to experience, namely all the collectibles that I didn’t find, and the Explorer mode will be helpful for those wishing to complete every list.  The puzzles are a great variety, and no one puzzle seemed to stick around for too long or become tiresome, especially with the inventive hint mechanic.  If you like games that are not only fun and engaging to play, but also look excellent, Summertime Madness is the debut passion project from DP Games that turned out beautifully, and I hope you’ll get the chance to enjoy it too.			</div>

																Difficulty : 2/5 (Normal)<br>Global : 0.5/5 (Bad)<br><br>Summertime Madness is a 3D puzzle game, you're a painter trapped in his painting and you solve puzzles to escape.<br>The game has a timer, or rather you're supposed to play with a timer (the lowest "difficulty" disables it fortunately). I don't understand the timer thing when you have a world to explore and collectibles to find but whatever. Even with the worst timer (3h) you should be good.<br>The island you see in the screenshots can be explored but the game is not an open world, it's linear with puzzles appearing one by one.<br><br>Now what are those puzzles about? What's the special mechanic? Well, there is none. The majority of them consists of slowly exploring a big maze and pulling levers that activate things. And that's why I can't recommend this game. <br>Maybe if the running speed was 2 or 3 times faster, the game would've been decent. That's a shame because it's not VERY bad, the mazes are not totally braindead but the gigantic amount of time you waste walking is just not acceptable.<br><br>Summertime Madness is a collection of tedious and not very interesting puzzles, and games that blatantly try to waste your time are a big no.			</div>

																Lovely visuals, a great first hour before sadly descending into a level-pulling misadventure that hops between worlds but gives you so little clue as to what does what that you easily get lost. Spent an hour walking in circles before giving up.			</div>

																Summertime Madness - Красивая игра с нелогичными головоломками. Вечно ходишь по лабиринтам или длинным коридорам пытаясь наугад найти решение. Система подсказок полунамеки не помогающие прохождению.<br>Все в духе сам догадайся. Например: Почти в конце игры появляется много дверей, нужно открыть верные, однако как это работает? Абсолютно не ясно в итоге тыкаешь наугад. После длинный коридор с дверьми, а подсказок в этот момент как опций нет. Он бесконечный. Выяснилось, что надо зайти в 13 дверь, что бы пройти дальше. Как об этом догадаться? В игре даже повествования такого нет, что бы косвенно понять, что это 13. Дошел до 52 потратил 30 минут посмотрел видео и потом еще 30 минут топал назад. Очень интересно. Сама игра проходиться за 2 часа. Если вынуть лабиринты, то игра проходится минут за 40. <br>Сюжет: Его нет, какие то идеи о художнике, катарсисе через искусство. Эмоций и времени бытия примерно такой винегрет. Связи между элементами отсутствуют. Таким обзором игра всеми силами пытается соответствовать названию Летние Безумие. Лучше уж Летние Беззубие. Категорическое нет.<br>			</div>

																大部分解谜挺一般的，楼梯那关很惊艳，水上城市也不错。个人感觉一些提示没啥卵用，白白消耗了过关的时间。而且所有的谜题还都有个共同特点，就是突出一个绕路，我在水上城市那里绕着绕着就忘了之前的机关在哪了。不过场景和美术不错，打折不亏，py几块钱血赚。<br><br>看了下别人的通关视频，我在最终的终点前也只有几个机关要踩，但鉴于游戏主角跑得实在是不够快，而且谜题还各种绕路，所以就不打算玩第二遍了。			</div>

																A mecânica de timer não combina nada com o estilo do jogo, principalmente porque a maioria dos puzzles são só de andar de um lado para o outro com um personagem bastante lento, mas pelo menos o jogo é bonito.			</div>

																What would have been a beautiful walking simulator if it wasn't full of time-wasting and pace-killing trial and error "puzzles". I knew the reviews weren't great going in, but for $0.95 on sale I figured it was worth a shot and installed it a few weeks later. My first urge to refund came after starting the game and learning that WASD was mandatory. I found that I could muddle through on a PS controller, and pressed on. An hour in, after being presented with the genuinely impressive revelation of Neo Prague, I fell asleep while trying to navigate the labyrinthine switch puzzle contained within. After waking up and removing my character's face from the wall he had been treadmilling against for the last minute, I gave up. This wasn't fun, nor did the artwork outweigh the chore. I considered refunding for the second time, only to remember the pittance I paid for it and was too embarrassed to ask.<br><br><div class="bb_h1">The Good</div>+Visually appealing<br>+Devs responded to a number of player gripes since release, mostly revolving around time limits<br><br><div class="bb_h1">YMMV</div>~Game only saves when puzzles are complete<br><br>~Only about 3 hours long if you're dedicated enough<br><br>~A number of collectibles, but they don't seem to do much and you'll probably only accidentally find some obscure ones half-way through - and this definitely isn't a game you'll replay to complete the set.<br><br>~Personally, the premise of story seemed counter-intuitive to me.

																画面和美术风格喜欢，风景和雕塑之类的设计都很不错。<br>不过感觉剧情和标题没啥关系啊，也不知道哪里summer哪里mad。关卡标题感觉有哲学意识流，但其实不太明白。<br>谜题的设计有点没品位。前几关的表现还不错，好看的风景加上好懂的谜题，机关和门都在目及之处，稍微绕一下就解决了。<br>然而从“地下室”开始就越来越灾难了……错位的空间，传送门完全没有逻辑，全靠瞎走和背板找路。“未来的回忆”更是对路痴的极大不友好。相似的风景，还分成了两个平行世界……根本不知道机关和门在哪里，绕路也绕不明白。游戏内置的提示也根本什么都没提示……最后靠跟着视频攻略一步步走才通过……最后“时间”的大迷宫更是无语，纯纯的迷宫，分叉多，走很远然后是个死路。也根本不知道目标在哪里，总之所有的岔路都走了就找到了，完全靠穷举……通关之后也是一点成就感没有。<br>不至于差评，但是没有中评，而且我确实不会推荐给其他玩家，就这样吧。			</div>

																I couldn't play on high quality as the painting filter plus the motion of the trees made me nauseous. The game itself is very easy and short, took me less than 2 hours for my first playthrough. While I didn't find most of the secrets, I don't see much replay value either. I cant recommend it for the $13 normal price. But it is interesting enough to be worth a play if it is on sale. Just don't expect it to take very long.			</div>

																A TRUE MASTERPIECE! The settings are fantastic, the music and graphics bring you to a wonderful world. The puzzles are well balanced, hard enough to intrigue me, but not too hard to let me down; in addition, the mechanics of the watch are fantastic.<br>THE STORY IMMEDIATELY CAPTURES YOU, blending real events with a compelling tale. <br>The game accompanied me for many afternoons, relaxing as I did just before. <br>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. &lt;3			</div>

																Well made, and time well spent. That is, only ~3 hours of time well spent...<br><br>The game does not hold your hand when it comes to presenting you with puzzles/problems. I liked that about it, others may find it obnoxious, and it would be a valid opinion. It's far  more intuitive than, say, Antechamber, but isn't some glorified walking simulator labeled as a puzzle game. You WILL have to use your brain, and there were some clever/satisfying solutions. The last "level" of the game was distinctly weaker than the rest. And if the most damning thing I can say is that the game had one bad level, and I wanted it to be longer, then it must be pretty good.<br><br>Basically, if this game had a stronger final act and was wayyyyy longer, then it very well could have achieved excellence. That said, I'm still comfortable calling it a pleasant and worthwhile endeavor.			</div>

																Summertime Madness is such a beautiful game, it's an heartwarming experience for both your mind and your soul. Everything has been masterfully built to let you truly feel inside the painted world while experiencing the painter's feelings.<br><br>If you liked titles like Journey and The Witness you are also gonna like this for sure. Recomended.			</div>

																i only found out about this game one day before its release, but the story and the visuals pulled me in immediately. visually, it does look a little derivative of games like The Witness, but i think given the concept it's justifiable.<br><br>the puzzles are mostly pretty challenging, and perhaps the difficulty ramps up too steeply early on. but it's challenging enough to keep you hooked in and entertained. it helped keep the tense and urgent mood, but i would have liked to see more of the devil to keep up that tension!<br><br>there are some flaws about the game that have understandably come up in reviews/community discussions so far, such as the harsh time limit. however the devs seem SO impressively responsive and have listened to these complaints and added explorer mode, which is great for people like me who are perhaps a little slow at puzzles. there is one level in particular that is so tediously difficult that it reaches a point of frustration, and throughout the game the hints are either too easy or too complex. but the game is saved by the beautiful artwork. it is a little confusing to me how the main character is trapped in his own paintings, but the levels seem to exist in paintings by other artists such as Escher or Magritte, but that might be my own confusion! it's still lovely to see how well different artists were incorporated into the game without the game abruptly changing styles.<br><br>overall i'd recommend, but with caution. the developers clearly put a LOT of passion into this, but the gameplay isn't quite up to scratch at times. however i'm excited to replay and continue exploring the world!			</div>

																a nice short puzzle game to play if ya got a few bucks to spare, for anyone really worried about playing any of the time limit modes I was able to beat it first try withing 2.4 hours with only moderate skill in puzzle games (though I still do highly recommend playing this in one of the modes with a time limit for the added flavor) and that's without getting all of the hidden collectibles as well			</div>

																If you’re a fan of first-person puzzle games like Myst, The Witness and The Talos Principle, Summertime Madness is an indie gem requiring your attention. Set in 1945, you play as a painter who makes a mysterious pact to escape his war-torn country and enter one of his paintings. But there’s a catch, if the painter isn’t able to find his way out by midnight, his soul will be forever trapped in the painting.  <br><br>The game takes inspiration from works of classic literature, such as Christopher Marlowe’s Dr. Faustus, but, perhaps, has more in common with Oscar Wilde’s The Picture of Dorian Gray – another story about a secret pact centred around a painting.  <br><br>The graphics of the game are stunning. The colours are striking, and the attention to detail impressive, particularly the way the wind blows blades of grass back and forth.  <br><br>Once in the world of the painting, you land in a hub world of sorts. From here, you complete a series of puzzle dioramas, with the first taking place on a ship. Others include a lighthouse and an urban city. All, in some way, are connected to the hub world, which evolves, and becomes more populated with new things as you complete each puzzle area. <br><br>I really liked the way each diorama features a distinctly different aesthetic and has its own unique puzzles. You go from be able to rotate floating platforms in one area to get to a distant door, to finding your way out of an Escher-like maze in another. Some puzzles can be quite tough, and definitely require creative thinking, but there’s nothing fans of the genre should have too much of a problem with.  Plus, there is a hint system, allowing you a tip at the expense of time.  <br><br>And time is important. At the start of the game, there are two game modes: Standard, which gives you 6 hours to complete the game, and Hard, where you have only 3hrs. Clocks are everywhere in the game, reminding you how long you have left. If you fail to escape in the allotted time, you lose, and your soul is trapped in the painting forever.  <br><br>Both difficulties actually provide you with more time than you need, as the game can be completed in under 90 mins if you know exactly what you are doing. But that’s not going to happen on a first playthrough!  <br><br>Overall, Summertime Madness is a highly polished first-person puzzler, which features an intriguing story, a memorable world and inventive puzzles.<br><br>The game features in my 'Indies of the Week' video here: <div class="dynamiclink_box " onclick="DynamicLink_PlayYouTubeVideoInline( this, &quot;dL0rPQQVdAQ&quot; );">

																A great little game to spend your afternoon on, cool scenery and art style which kind of reminds me of The Witness, I especially like the scenery and atmosphere in <span class="bb_spoiler"><span>Neo Prague</span></span> level. The Puzzles are quite easy but still requires some thinking.			</div>

																Have had a fantastic time playing Summertime Madness and I can not wait to get into the Expert Mode or even the Explorer Mode! This is such a special game and I recommend anyone who loves puzzle solving and Artist game design to download and play this game. If not than go check out my gameplay!			</div>

																一个精致的，艺术气息浓厚的超现实主义第一人称解谜小品。<br><br>游戏最抓人眼球的自然是画风了，明亮轻淡的风格不像是油画，而是像水彩。游戏内超现实的场景充满了对画家们的致敬——我能看出的致敬有达利、梵高、勒内、埃舍尔这四个人。<br><br>不过比较遗憾的是游戏的解谜并没有与超现实的场景结合起来。除了一两个惊艳的解谜之外，大部分解谜都比较传统——找规律、拉开关、转转盘、配天平之类的。游戏是关卡式的，不是探索解密。解谜难度在中上水平，主要是地图太绕：特别是楼梯和城市这两关，玩家只能像个无头苍蝇一样乱转，很容易让人产生弃游的心理。但是瞎折腾几十分钟后莫名其妙就过了，我都不知道自己怎么过的……游戏内置的提示多少有点用，但是用处不大，聊胜于无。<br><br>游戏有个比较有争议的地方就是它是有时间限制的，普通难度6小时，进阶难度3小时，每用一次游戏内置的提示会消耗15分钟。乍看之下非常吓人，不过实际上普通难度给的时间相当充裕，平均通关时间在3小时左右，算上叫四次提示用掉1小时，还剩两小时。如果是解谜游戏老手，直接玩进阶难度也是没问题的，不看提示的话一周目3小时不难进。不过游戏给的时间充裕不代表我支持这种给游戏加上时间限制的行为，时间限制会持续地给玩家施加压迫感，可能让玩家一心想着通关而忽略了游戏内的风景，对于步行模拟解谜游戏来说这是本末倒置的做法。不过开发者说后续会直接解锁一周目的探索模式，所以这不算个问题。<br><br>最后说下游戏剧情，虽然说剧情非常简单，但是意境却很棒。一个与恶魔订下契约的画家，获得了短暂的逃离痛苦的现实遁入画中的机会，而就像辛德瑞拉一样，这个美妙的时光只持续到午夜12点。也许画家一开始就知道与恶魔的约定是不会有好结果的，但是他还是为了瞥见美的一瞬而赌上了自己的生命。正如开发者所说，这是个献给被疯狂所吞没、却依然要追求梦想者的游戏。<br><br>总之，对解谜玩家、步行模拟玩家、风景党、文艺青年，推荐。			</div>

																Summertime Madness got amazing visuals, the scenery is beautiful. The voice acting is pretty decent and the soundtrack doesn't get you over the edge when you are struggling with a puzzle. Speaking, the puzzles are pretty fun too!			</div>

																With a haunting gorgeous world and rather perplexing puzzles to conquer, Summertime Madness is another easy thumbs up for those who love exploration games.  The time restraints to create a bit of stress, and taking advantage of hints will subtract from the allotted time bank, creating a pretty significant contrast from the melancholy feel the game gives you.  If you have the patience for some of it's deeper puzzles, Summertime Madness should definitely be on your radar.			</div>
